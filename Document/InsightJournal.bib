abstract = {We describe an interactive, computer-assisted framework for combining parts of a set of photographs into a single composite picture, a process we call "digital photomontage." Our framework makes use of two techniques primarily: graph-cut optimization, to choose good seams within the constituent images so that they can be combined as seamlessly as possible; and gradient-domain fusion, a process based on Poisson equations, to further reduce any remaining visible artifacts in the composite. Also central to the framework is a suite of interactive tools that allow the user to specify a variety of high-level image objectives, either globally across the image, or locally through a painting-style interface. Image objectives are applied independently at each pixel location and generally involve a function of the pixel values (such as "maximum contrast") drawn from that same location in the set of source images. Typically, a user applies a series of image objectives iteratively in order to create a finished composite. The power of this framework lies in its generality; we show how it can be used for a wide variety of applications, including "selective composites" (for instance, group photos in which everyone looks their best), relighting, extended depth of field, panoramic stitching, clean-plate production, stroboscopic visualization of movement, and time-lapse mosaics.},

In this Review, we discuss the potential role of MRI and nuclear molecular imaging in providing additional insights into the response to cardiac resynchronization therapy. Variables with potential prognostic and therapeutic values include the evaluation of cardiac dyssynchrony, scar, cardiac sympathetic function, myocardial blood flow, myocardial glucose and oxidative metabolism. Other molecular targets to characterize apoptosis, fatty acid metabolism, angiogenesis and angiotensin-converting enzyme activity will also be described.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quantitative analysis of segmental myocardial deformation of different myocardial layers has become possible using strain-encoded cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (SENC) and speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE). We evaluated and compared the quantitative analysis of myocardial deformation using SENC and STE.

METHODS: In 44 patients (age 61 ± 13 years, 34 men), SENC by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging using a 1.5-Tesla whole-body scanner and two-dimensional STE were performed prospectively. Quantitative layer-specific analysis of segmental left ventricular function was performed to determine the peak circumferential and peak longitudinal systolic strain values using SENC and STE of an endocardial and epicardial myocardial layer. In addition, segmental function was defined as normokinetic, hypokinetic, or akinetic by visual analysis of the magnetic resonance imaging cine sequences.

RESULTS: The endocardial and epicardial strain defined by SENC or STE differed significantly between the visually defined segmental function states. The correlation of the peak circumferential endocardial strain by SENC versus STE (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] 0.493, 95\% CI 0.358-0.597) tended to be better than the correlation of the circumferential epicardial strain using both methods (ICC 0.321, 95\% CI 0.238-0.399). The correlation of the peak longitudinal endocardial strain by SENC and STE was similar (ICC 0.472, 95\% CI 0.398-0.541), in contrast to the longitudinal epicardial strain analysis by both techniques (ICC 0.554, 95\% CI 0.417-0.655). Circumferential strain analysis by STE allowed better distinction of the hypokinetic or akinetic segments from the normokinetic segments than did the circumferential strain analysis by SENC of the endocardial layer (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC ROC] 0.946 vs 0.884; P < .001) or epicardial layer (AUC ROC 0.884 vs 0.782; P < .001). Longitudinal strain analysis using STE and SENC of the endocardial layer (AUC ROC 0.851 vs 0.839; P = .5838) and epicardial layer (AUC ROC 0.849 vs 0.833; P = .4321) had similar diagnostic value for identifying the presence of hypokinetic and akinetic segments.

CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative analysis of segmental deformation by SENC and STE allowed accurate distinction of myocardial segments with different functional states. Circumferential endocardial strain analysis by STE allowed the best distinction of segments with impaired function from the normokinetic segments.},

abstract = {The aim is to detect early changes in myocardial mechanics in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) mutation carriers, three-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (3DSTE) was used for screening of family members in the HCM population. Eighty subjects were divided as: HCM mutation carriers (n = 23), manifest HCM patients (n = 28), and normal controls (n = 29). They prospectively underwent 3DSTE for left atrial (LA) and left ventricle (LV) strain analysis. HCM mutation carriers showed significantly higher LA minimum volume (ml/m(2)) (17 ± 6 vs. 14 ± 4, respectively, P = 0.03) and a significantly lower peak atrial longitudinal strain (PALS) (\%), (27 ± 5 vs. 31 ± 7, respectively, P = 0.02) when compared to controls. However, no differences were found in global or regional LV systolic myocardial deformation between both groups. Manifest HCM patients, compared to carriers showed significantly higher LA minimum (27 ± 10 vs. 17 ± 6, respectively, P < 0.001) and maximum volume (42 ± 14 vs. 32 ± 8, respectively, P = 0.007) as well as lower LA ejection fraction (\%) (35 ± 8 vs. 47 ± 9, respectively, P < 0.001) and PALS (17 ± 5 vs. 27 ± 5, respectively, P < 0.001). Comparing LV strain, HCM patients showed reduced global longitudinal (-11 ± 4 vs. -16 ± 3, respectively, P < 0.001) and area strain (-35 ± 6 vs. -40 ± 5, respectively, P = 0.005). HCM mutation carriers may be distinguished from healthy subjects using 3DSTE through detection of LA dysfunction that may indicate LV diastolic dysfunction. Further research in a larger study population with gene-specific analysis is warranted for potential clinical usefulness of 3DSTE in family screening for HCM.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND AIM: The identification of right ventricular abnormalities in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) in early stages is still difficult. The aim of this study was to investigate if longitudinal strain based on speckle tracking can detect subtle right (RV) or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction as an early sign of ARVC.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventeen male patients, fulfilling Task force criteria for ARVC, 49 (32-70) years old, nineteen male first degree relatives 29 (19-73) y.o. and twenty-two healthy male volunteers 36 (24-66) y.o participated in the study. Twelve-lead and signal-averaged electrocardiograms were recorded. All subjects underwent echocardiography. LV and RV diameters, peak systolic velocity from tissue Doppler and longitudinal strain based on speckle tracking were measured from the basal and mid segments in both ventricles. RV longitudinal strain measurement was successful in first degree relatives and controls (95 resp. 86\%) but less feasible in patients (59\%). Results were not systematically different between first degree relatives and controls. Using discriminant analysis, we then developed an index based on echocardiographic parameters. All normal controls had an index<l while patients with abnormal ventricles had an index between 1-4. Some of the first degree relatives deviated from the normal pattern.

CONCLUSION: Longitudinal strain of LV and RV segments was significantly lower in patients than in relatives and controls. An index was developed incorporating dimensional and functional echocardiographic parameters. In combination with genetic testing this index might help to detect early phenotype expression in mutation carriers.},

@article{Badran2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) have normal ejection fractions at rest, the investigators hypothesized that these patients have differentially abnormal systolic function reserves, limiting their exercise capacity compared with patients with hypertension (HTN).

METHODS: Forty patients with HCM (mean age, 39.1 ± 12 years), 20 patients with HTN with LVH, and 33 healthy individuals underwent resting and peak exercise echocardiography using two-dimensional strain imaging. Peak longitudinal systolic strain ($\epsilon$sys) and strain rate were measured in apical views. Circumferential $\epsilon$sys and left ventricular (LV) twist were analyzed from short-axis views. LV systolic dyssynchrony was measured from regional longitudinal strain curves as the standard deviation of time to peak strain (time from the beginning of the Q wave on electrocardiography to peak $\epsilon$sys) between 12 segments. The differences between resting and peak exercise values were analyzed, and functional reserve was calculated as the difference divided by the resting value.

RESULTS: In patients with HCM, resting values for longitudinal $\epsilon$sys, systolic strain rate, early diastolic strain rate, and atrial diastolic strain rate were significantly lower, while circumferential $\epsilon$sys and twist were higher, compared with patients with HTN and controls (P < .0001). Functional systolic reserve increased during exercise in controls (17 ± 6\%), increased to a lesser extent in patients with HTN (10 ± 16\%), and was markedly attenuated in patients with HCM (-23 ± 28\%) (P < .001). At peak exercise, even with augmented circumferential $\epsilon$sys and twist in patients with HCM (P < .01) compared with those with HTN, both remained lower than in controls (P < .001). LV dyssynchrony was amplified during exercise in patients with HCM compared with those with HTN (P < .001). Within the entire population, exercise capacity was clearly correlated with systolic functional reserve. However when taken separately, it was mainly related to resting LV dyssynchrony and diastolic function in patients with HCM, whereas it was linked to age and LV wall thickness in those with HTN.

CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HCM have significantly limited systolic function reserve and more dynamic dyssynchrony with exercise compared with those with HTN. Two-dimensional strain imaging during stress may provide a new and reliable method to identify patients at higher cardiovascular risk.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To present a single-step deterministic procedure for unwrapping MRI phase maps.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using an algorithm previously developed for optical applications, Laplacian operators were applied in the Fourier space of the MRI phase map. The original Fourier-based phase unwrapping algorithm was modified so that demodulation accomplished the required signal symmetrization in Fourier space. To evaluate the method's performance in the presence of thermal noise, a set of wrapped phase maps were simulated at different levels of noise in k-space, and the response of the algorithm at different levels of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was evaluated for stability. To demonstrate its utility in MRI, the algorithm was applied to the wrapped phase maps of susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) studies, which were then used to generate venograms.

RESULTS: In simulated phase wrapping, the algorithm correctly reproduced the original phase for a wide range of phase gradients and noise. The procedure was fast and produced useful maps of venous structures in SWI images.

CONCLUSION: A fast and stable single-step deterministic method for unwrapping MRI phase maps is available for such applications as SWI and mapping of static magnetic field inhomogeneity.},

abstract = {Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder of heart muscle that is associated with ventricular arrhythmias and risk of sudden cardiac death, particularly in the young and athletes. Mutations in five genes that encode major components of the desmosomes, namely junction plakoglobin, desmoplakin, plakophilin-2, desmoglein-2, and desmocollin-2, have been identified in approximately half of affected probands. AC is, therefore, commonly considered a 'desmosomal' disease. No single test is sufficiently specific to establish a diagnosis of AC. The diagnostic criteria for AC were revised in 2010 to improve sensitivity, but maintain specificity. Quantitative parameters were introduced and identification of a pathogenic mutation in a first-degree relative has become a major diagnostic criterion. Caution in the interpretation of screening results is highly recommended because a 'pathogenic' mutation is difficult to define. Experimental data confirm that this genetically determined cardiomyopathy develops after birth because of progressive myocardial dystrophy, and is initiated by cardiomyocyte necrosis; cellular and animal models are necessary to gain insight into the cascade of underlying molecular events. Crosstalk from the desmosome to the nucleus, gap junctions, and ion channels is under investigation, to move from symptomatic to targeted therapy, with the ultimate aim to stop disease onset and progression.},

This simulator proposes an efficient management of the T2* effect, and in a unique simulator integrates most of the simulation features that are offered in different simulators. It takes into account the main static field value and enables realistic simulations of the chemical shift artifact, including off-resonance phenomena. It also simulates the artifacts linked to the static field inhomogeneity like those induced by susceptibility variation within an object. It is implemented in the C language and the MRI sequence programming is done using high level C functions with a simple programming interface. To manage large simulations, the magnetization kernel is implemented in a parallelized way that enables simulation on PC grid architecture. Furthermore, this simulator includes a 1D interactive interface for pedagogic purpose illustrating the magnetization vector motion as well as the MRI contrasts.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) has major implications for the management of patients and their first-degree relatives. Diagnosis is based on a set of criteria proposed by the International Task Force for Cardiomyopathies. We report our experience in providing a re-evaluation for patients who previously have been diagnosed with ARVD/C.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 89 patients who requested a re-evaluation for diagnosis of ARVD/C at our center. Each of these patients had been diagnosed with ARVD/C at their initial evaluation. Each patient was re-evaluated with clinical history, physical examination, and noninvasive testing at our center. Invasive testing, which included electrophysiologic testing, right ventricular angiography, and endomyocardial biopsy, was performed when clinically indicated. Sixty (92\%) of the 65 patients who had undergone magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at an outside institution were reported to have an abnormal MRI consistent with ARVD/C. Among these patients, the only abnormality identified was the qualitative finding of intramyocardial fat/wall thinning in 46 patients. On re-evaluation, these qualitative findings were not confirmed. None of these 46 patients ultimately were diagnosed with ARVD/C. Among the entire patient group, only 24 (27\%) of the 89 patients met the Task Force criteria for ARVD/C.

CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the high frequency of "misdiagnosis" of ARVD/C is due to over-reliance on the presence of intramyocardial fat/wall thinning on MRI, incomplete diagnostic testing, and lack of awareness of the Task Force criteria. Diagnosis of ARVD/C cannot rely solely upon qualitative features on MRI.},

abstract = {Fractal geometry has been applied widely in the analysis of medical images to characterize the irregular complex tissue structures that do not lend themselves to straightforward analysis with traditional Euclidean geometry. In this study, we treat the nonfractal behaviour of medical images over large-scale ranges by considering their box-counting fractal dimension as a scale-dependent parameter rather than a single number. We describe this approach in the context of the more generalized R\'{e}nyi entropy, in which we can also compute the information and correlation dimensions of images. In addition, we describe and validate a computational improvement to box-counting fractal analysis. This improvement is based on integral images, which allows the speedup of any box-counting or similar fractal analysis algorithm, including estimation of scale-dependent dimensions. Finally, we applied our technique to images of invasive breast cancer tissue from 157 patients to show a relationship between the fractal analysis of these images over certain scale ranges and pathologic tumour grade (a standard prognosticator for breast cancer). Our approach is general and can be applied to any medical imaging application in which the complexity of pathological image structures may have clinical value.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We determined the contribution of multiple variables to predict arrhythmic death and total mortality risk in patients with coronary disease and left ventricular dysfunction. We then constructed an algorithm to predict risk of mortality and sudden death.

BACKGROUND: Many factors in addition to ejection fraction (EF) influence the prognosis of patients with coronary disease. However, there are few tools to use this information to guide clinical decisions.

METHODS: We evaluated the relationship between 25 variables and total mortality and arrhythmic death in 674 patients enrolled in the MUSTT (Multicenter Unsustained Tachycardia Trial) study that did not receive antiarrhythmic therapy. We then constructed risk-stratification algorithms to weight the prognostic impact of each variable on arrhythmic death and total mortality risk.

RESULTS: The variables having the greatest prognostic impact in multivariable analysis were functional class, history of heart failure, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia not related to bypass surgery, EF, age, left ventricular conduction abnormalities, inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia, enrollment as an inpatient, and atrial fibrillation. The model demonstrates that patients whose only risk factor is EF < or =30\% have a predicted 2-year arrhythmic death risk <5\%.

CONCLUSIONS: Multiple variables influence arrhythmic death and total mortality risk. Patients with EF < or =30\% but no other risk factor have low predicted mortality risk. Patients with EF >30\% and other risk factors may have higher mortality and a higher risk of sudden death than some patients with EF < or =30\%. Thus, risk of sudden death in patients with coronary disease depends on multiple variables in addition to EF.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mutations in genes coding for sarcomeric proteins cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Subtle abnormalities of the myocardium may be present in mutation carriers without left ventricular hypertrophy (G+LVH-) but are difficult to quantify. Fractal analysis has been used to define trabeculae in left ventricular noncompaction and to identify normal racial variations. We hypothesized that trabeculae measured by fractal analysis of cardiovascular magnetic resonance images are abnormal in G+LVH- patients, providing a preclinical marker of disease in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance was performed on 40 G+LVH- patients (33±15 years, 38\% men), 67 patients with a clinical diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (53±15 years, 76\% men; 31 with a pathogenic mutation [G+LVH+]), and 69 matched healthy volunteers (44±15 years, 57\% men). Trabeculae were quantified by fractal analysis of cine slices to calculate the fractal dimension, a unitless index of endocardial complexity calculated from endocardial contours after segmentation. In G+LVH- patients, apical left ventricular trabeculation was increased compared with controls (maximal apical fractal dimension, 1.249±0.07 versus 1.199±0.05; P=0.001). In G+LVH+ and G-LVH+ cohorts, maximal apical fractal dimension was greater than in controls (P<0.0001) irrespective of gene status (G+LVH+: 1.370±0.08; G-LVH+: 1.380±0.09). Compared with controls, G+LVH- patients also had a higher frequency of clefts (28\% versus 8\%; P=0.02), longer anterior mitral valve leaflets (23.5±3.0 versus 19.7±3.1 mm; P<0.0001), greater septal systolic wall thickness (12.6±3.2 versus 11.2±2.1 mm; P=0.03), higher ejection fraction (71±4\% versus 69±4\%; P=0.03), and smaller end-systolic volumes (38±9 versus 43±12 mL; P=0.03).

CONCLUSIONS: Increased myocardial trabecular complexity is one of several preclinical abnormalities in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy sarcomere gene mutation carriers without LVH.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a myocardial disorder characterized by excessive left ventricular (LV) trabeculae. Current methods for quantification of LV trabeculae have limitations. The aim of this study is to describe a novel technique for quantifying LV trabeculation using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and fractal geometry. Observing that trabeculae appear complex and irregular, we hypothesize that measuring the fractal dimension (FD) of the endocardial border provides a quantitative parameter that can be used to distinguish normal from abnormal trabecular patterns.

METHODS: Fractal analysis is a method of quantifying complex geometric patterns in biological structures. The resulting FD is a unitless measure index of how completely the object fills space. FD increases with increased structural complexity. LV FD was measured using a box-counting method on CMR short-axis cine stacks. Three groups were studied: LVNC (defined by Jenni criteria), n=30(age 41±13; men, 16); healthy whites, n=75(age, 46±16; men, 36); healthy blacks, n=30(age, 40±11; men, 15).

RESULTS: In healthy volunteers FD varied in a characteristic pattern from base to apex along the LV. This pattern was altered in LVNC where apical FD were abnormally elevated. In healthy volunteers, blacks had higher FD than whites in the apical third of the LV (maximal apical FD: 1.253±0.005 vs. 1.235±0.004, p<0.01) (mean±s.e.m.). Comparing LVNC with healthy volunteers, maximal apical FD was higher in LVNC (1.392±0.010, p<0.00001). The fractal method was more accurate and reproducible (ICC, 0.97 and 0.96 for intra and inter-observer readings) than two other CMR criteria for LVNC (Petersen and Jacquier).

CONCLUSIONS: FD is higher in LVNC patients compared to healthy volunteers and is higher in healthy blacks than in whites. Fractal analysis provides a quantitative measure of trabeculation and has high reproducibility and accuracy for LVNC diagnosis when compared to current CMR criteria.},

abstract = {Following B.B. Mandelbrot's fractal theory (1982), it was found that the fractal dimension could be obtained in medical images by the concept of fractional Brownian motion. An estimation concept for determination of the fractal dimension based upon the concept of fractional Brownian motion is discussed. Two applications are found: (1) classification; (2) edge enhancement and detection. For the purpose of classification, a normalized fractional Brownian motion feature vector is defined from this estimation concept. It represented the normalized average absolute intensity difference of pixel pairs on a surface of different scales. The feature vector uses relatively few data items to represent the statistical characteristics of the medial image surface and is invariant to linear intensity transformation. For edge enhancement and detection application, a transformed image is obtained by calculating the fractal dimension of each pixel over the whole medical image. The fractal dimension value of each pixel is obtained by calculating the fractal dimension of 7x7 pixel block centered on this pixel.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Peak strain has been promising as an index of wall motion but it is sometimes susceptible to the image quality.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the feasibility of a novel index, transmural myocardial strain gradient (TMSG), derived from myocardial strain M-mode imaging (TDI-Q, Toshiba) for quantifying regional systolic wall motion.

METHOD: We measured transmural myocardial strain distribution at the left ventricular lateral, posterior, inferior, septal, anteroseptal and anterior walls in the basal and midventricular short-axis images using TDI-Q. Twenty normals (35 ± 3 years) and 35 consecutive patients (63 ± 9 years) with coronary artery disease (CAD, 19 patients with old myocardial infarction, 4 patients with acute myocardial infarction, 12 patients with angina pectoris) were studied. Peak strain, endocardial- and epicardial-half strain and TMSG ((peak strain, - epicardial strain)/distance between peak and epicardial points) were obtained. Coefficient of variation (CV) of each index was calculated.

RESULTS: In control subjects, the best reproducibility of the variables was obtained for TMSG with the smallest CV (11.6\%) (27.8\%, 28.1\%, and 35.5\%, respectively for CV of peak strain, endocardial- and epicardial-half strain). All segments in control subjects and normal segments in CAD patients showed no significant difference in TMSG (15.1 ± 1.8 vs. 15.1 ± 1.6\%/mm, P = ns). TMSG was the lowest for akinetic segments and highest for the normal segments (P < 0.001).

CONCLUSION: TMSG was more robust than simple strain values to quantitatively assess wall motion. This could successfully identify subtle regional differences in wall function.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Conventional calculation of myocardial strain requires tissue-tracking. A surrogate for strain called global fractional shortening (GFS) is proposed based on changes in dimensions of endocardial and epicardial surfaces without tissue-tracking.

METHODS: Three-dimensional endocardial and epicardial left ventricular surfaces traced at end-diastole and end-systole using conventional steady-state free precession cine images were used to calculate GFScc (circumferential), GFSll (longitudinal), and GFSrr (radial) using fractional length changes in each direction over the heart surface. GFS values were validated using finite element models (FEM) and in vivo using tagging-derived strains ($\epsilon$cc ,$\epsilon$ll ,$\epsilon$rr ) in patients with a wide range of ejection fraction (EF) and diagnosis (n = 32). GFS was also measured in 31 patients with Fabry disease and matched healthy controls.

RESULTS: GFS values were within 3\% of average FEM-derived Lagrangian strains and had good agreement in vivo (GFScc  = -14 ± 4\%, $\epsilon$cc  = -14 ± 4\%, R(2)  = 0.85; GFSll  = -12 ± 4\%, $\epsilon$ll  = -12 ± 4\%, R(2)  = 0.72; GFSrr  = 46 ± 21\%). $\epsilon$rr could not be measured reliably from tagging. Compared with healthy controls with matched EF, patients with Fabry disease had significantly increased GFScc (Endo) (-28 ± 3\% versus -25 ± 2\%), decreased GFScc(Epi) (-10 ± 2\% versus -11 ± 2\%) and decreased GFSll for all components.

CONCLUSION: GFS yields similar values to conventionally measured strains without requiring tissue-tracking. Compared with controls, patients with Fabry disease have significant differences in several GFS components. Magn Reson Med, 2014. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Myocardial thickening/thinning indices is one method of attempting to define regional myocardial function. A new ultrasonic method of quantifying regional deformation has been introduced based on the principles of 'strain' and 'strain rate' imaging. These new imaging modes introduce concepts derived from mechanical engineering which most echocardiographers are not familiar with. In order to maximally exploit these new techniques, an understanding of what they measure is indispensable. This paper will define each of these modalities in terms of physical principles and will give an introduction to the principles of data acquisition and processing required to implement ultrasonic strain and strain rate imaging. In addition, the current status of development of the technique and its limitations will be discussed, together with examples of potential clinical applications.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) is an inherited cardiomyopathy characterized by right ventricular dysfunction and ventricular arrhythmias. The purpose of our study was to describe the presentation, clinical features, survival, and natural history of ARVD in a large cohort of patients from the United States.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The patient population included 100 ARVD patients (51 male; median age at presentation, 26 [interquartile range \{IQR\}, 18 to 38; range, 2 to 70] years). A familial pattern was observed in 32 patients. The most common presenting symptoms were palpitations, syncope, and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in 27\%, 26\%, and 23\% of patients, respectively. Among those who were diagnosed while living (n=69), the median time between first presentation and diagnosis was 1 (range, 0 to 37) year. During a median follow-up of 6 (IQR, 2 to 13; range, 0 to 37) years, implantable cardioverter/defibrillators (ICD) were implanted in 47 patients, 29 of whom received an appropriate ICD discharge, including 3 patients who received the ICD for primary prevention. At follow-up, 66 patients were alive, of whom 44 had an ICD in place, 5 developed signs of heart failure, 2 had a heart transplant, and 18 were on drug therapy. Thirty-four patients died either at presentation (n=23: 21 SCD, 2 noncardiac deaths) or during follow-up (n=11: 10 SCD, 1 of biventricular heart failure), of whom only 3 were diagnosed while living and 1 had an ICD implanted. On Kaplan-Meier analysis, the median survival in the entire population was 60 years.

CONCLUSIONS: ARVD patients present between the second and fifth decades of life either with symptoms of palpitations and syncope associated with ventricular tachycardia or with SCD. Diagnosis is often delayed. Once diagnosed and treated with an ICD, mortality is low. There is a wide variation in presentation and course of ARVD patients, which can likely be explained by the genetic heterogeneity of the disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Noncontrast magnetic resonance T1 mapping reflects a composite of both intra- and extracellular signal. We hypothesized that noncontrast T1 mapping can characterize the myocardium beyond that achieved by the well-established late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) technique (which detects focal fibrosis) in both hypertrophic (HCM) and dilated (DCM) cardiomyopathy, by detecting both diffuse and focal fibrosis.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Subjects underwent Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance imaging at 3T (28 HCM, 18 DCM, and 12 normals). Matching short-axis slices were acquired for cine, T1 mapping, and LGE imaging (0.1 mmol/kg). Circumferential strain was measured in the midventricular slice, and (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy was acquired for the septum of the midventricular slice. Mean T1 relaxation time was increased in HCM and DCM (HCM 1209±28 ms, DCM 1225±42 ms, normal 1178±13 ms, P<0.05). There was a weak correlation between mean T1 and LGE (r=0.32, P<0.001). T1 values were higher in segments with LGE than in those without (HCM with LGE 1228±41 ms versus no LGE 1192±79 ms, P<0.01; DCM with LGE 1254±73 ms versus no LGE 1217±52 ms, P<0.01). However, in both HCM and DCM, even in segments unaffected by LGE, T1 values were significantly higher than normal (P<0.01). T1 values correlated with disease severity, being increased as wall thickness increased in HCM; conversely, in DCM, T1 values were highest in the thinnest myocardial segments. T1 values also correlated significantly with circumferential strain (r=0.42, P<0.01). Interestingly, this correlation remained statistically significant even for the slices without LGE (r=0.56, P=0.04). Finally, there was also a statistically significant negative correlation between T1 values and phosphocreatine/adenosine triphosphate ratios (r=-0.59, P<0.0001).

CONCLUSIONS: In HCM and DCM, noncontrast T1 mapping detects underlying disease processes beyond those assessed by LGE in relatively low-risk individuals.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop an unsupervised method for measuring quantitative three-dimensional regional strain in the left ventricular wall from tagged cardiac MR images.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 10 normal human volunteers and eight patients with myocardial infarction were imaged using a parallel tagged imaging protocol. Each study was analyzed using the combined tag tracking and strain reconstruction (COTTER) algorithm. In contrast to existing techniques, which first track tag lines independently in each slice, then reconstruct myocardial deformation, the COTTER algorithm fits a three-dimensional cardiac deformation model directly to the image data. This approach ensures that tag line positions identified in the image data are consistent from slice to slice. A total of 10 imaging studies (six normals, four patients) were used to optimize parameters of the COTTER algorithm.

RESULTS: In the remaining eight imaging studies, the root-mean-square difference between tags tracked by COTTER and user-supervised analysis was 0.66 pixels at end-systole. The correlation coefficient between circumferential shortening strains at end-systole computed by COTTER and user-supervised analysis was 0.84 (P < 0.005) at the midwall.

CONCLUSION: The COTTER algorithm can compute accurate measurements of three-dimensional regional strain without user supervision.},

abstract = {An efficient block matching and spectral shift estimation algorithm for freehand quasi-static ultrasound elastography is described in this paper. The proposed method provides a balance between computational speed and robustness against displacement estimation error and bias; a fundamental aspect of elastography. The new algorithm was tested on an extensive set of simulated 1-D RF ultrasound signals, replicating various strain profiles. Additionally, real 2-D scans were conducted on an ultrasound phantom with prescribed elastic properties; the algorithm output was further validated with a comparison to a finite element model (FEM) of the phantom. Clinical data from a breast cancer study and histology slides were used to demonstrate the in vivo use of the new elastography technique. The algorithm showed a significant computational savings (at least 60 times faster) over existing spectral shift analysis methods. Accurate strain images were produced in as little as 2 s with the scope for further speed enhancements through parallel processing; making real-time implementation a future possibility. Moreover, it demonstrated a robustness toward displacement estimation error when compared with conventional gradient-based techniques, and was able to perform at high strain values (>5\%) while showing relative insensitivity to various parameters settings, such as sample rate and block window size; a desirable performance for a practical clinical tool.},

abstract = {The quest for a practical index of relative body weight that began shortly after actuaries reported the increased mortality of their overweight policyholders culminated after World War II, when the relationship between weight and cardiovascular disease became the subject of epidemiological studies. It became evident then that the best index was the ratio of the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters, or the Quetelet Index described in 1832. Adolphe Quetelet (1796-1874) was a Belgian mathematician, astronomer and statistician, who developed a passionate interest in probability calculus that he applied to study human physical characteristics and social aptitudes. His pioneering cross-sectional studies of human growth led him to conclude that other than the spurts of growth after birth and during puberty, 'the weight increases as the square of the height', known as the Quetelet Index until it was termed the Body Mass Index in 1972 by Ancel Keys (1904-2004). For his application of comparative statistics to social conditions and moral issues, Quetelet is considered a founder of the social sciences. His principal work, 'A Treatise of Man and the development of his faculties' published in 1835 is considered 'one of the greatest books of the 19th century'. A tireless promoter of statistical data collection based on standard methods and definitions, Quetelet organized in 1853 the first International Statistical Congress, which launched the development of 'a uniform nomenclature of the causes of death applicable to all countries', progenitor of the current International Classification of Diseases.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD) in patients presenting with unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is controversial. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of AFD in a large, consecutive cohort of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) using rapid mutation screening.

DESIGN, SETTING AND PATIENTS: A European multicentre cross-sectional study involving 13 referral centres. Inclusion criteria for the study were: men aged at least 35 years and women aged at least 40 years with unexplained LVH (maximum left ventricular wall thickness ≥ 1.5 cm). All patients were screened using a denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography protocol for rapid mutation screening of the $\alpha$-galactosidase A ($\alpha$-Gal A) gene and, if a sequence variant was found, direct sequencing was performed. 1386 patients (63.9\% men, mean age 57.9 ± 12.0 years) were enrolled in the study.

RESULTS: Seven (0.5\%) patients (age 57.4 ± 9.0 years (45-72); three (43\%) men) had pathogenic $\alpha$-galactosidase A mutations. Polymorphisms were identified in 283 patients (20.4\%). Maximal left ventricular wall thickness in patients carrying a disease-causing mutation was 18 ± 2 mm (range 15-22); four patients had concentric LVH and the remainder had asymmetric septal hypertrophy.

CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of AFD gene mutations in a large, consecutive cohort of European patients with unexplained LVH is 0.5\%.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is frequently performed to measure accurate LV volumes and ejection fractions, LV volume-time curves (VTC) derived ejection and filling rates are not routinely calculated due to lack of robust LV segmentation techniques. VTC derived peak filling rates can be used to accurately assess LV diastolic function, an important clinical parameter. We developed a novel geometry-independent dual-contour propagation technique, making use of LV endocardial contours manually drawn at end systole and end diastole, to compute VTC and measured LV ejection and filling rates in hypertensive patients and normal volunteers.

METHODS: 39 normal volunteers and 49 hypertensive patients underwent CMR. LV contours were manually drawn on all time frames in 18 normal volunteers. The dual-contour propagation algorithm was used to propagate contours throughout the cardiac cycle. The results were compared to those obtained with single-contour propagation (using either end-diastolic or end-systolic contours) and commercially available software. We then used the dual-contour propagation technique to measure peak ejection rate (PER) and peak early diastolic and late diastolic filling rates (ePFR and aPFR) in all normal volunteers and hypertensive patients.

RESULTS: Compared to single-contour propagation methods and the commercial method, VTC by dual-contour propagation showed significantly better agreement with manually-derived VTC. Ejection and filling rates by dual-contour propagation agreed with manual (dual-contour - manual PER: -0.12 +/- 0.08; ePFR: -0.07 +/- 0.07; aPFR: 0.06 +/- 0.03 EDV/s, all P = NS). However, the time for the manual method was approximately 4 hours per study versus approximately 7 minutes for dual-contour propagation. LV systolic function measured by LVEF and PER did not differ between normal volunteers and hypertensive patients. However, ePFR was lower in hypertensive patients vs. normal volunteers, while aPFR was higher, indicative of altered diastolic filling rates in hypertensive patients.

CONCLUSION: Dual-propagated contours can accurately measure both systolic and diastolic volumetric indices that can be applied in a routine clinical CMR environment. With dual-contour propagation, the user interaction that is routinely performed to measure LVEF is leveraged to obtain additional clinically relevant parameters.},

abstract = {In 1953, Virginia Apgar, M.D. published her proposal for a new method of evaluation of the newborn infant. The avowed purpose of this paper was to establish a simple and clear classification of newborn infants which can be used to compare the results of obstetric practices, types of maternal pain relief and the results of resuscitation. Having considered several objective signs pertaining to the condition of the infant at birth she selected five that could be evaluated and taught to the delivery room personnel without difficulty. These signs were heart rate, respiratory effort, reflex irritability, muscle tone and color. Sixty seconds after the complete birth of the baby a rating of zero, one or two was given to each sign, depending on whether it was absent or present. Virginia Apgar reviewed anesthesia records of 1025 infants born alive at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center during the period of this report. All had been rated by her method. Infants in poor condition scored 0-2, infants in fair condition scored 3-7, while scores 8-10 were achieved by infants in good condition. The most favorable score 1 min after birth was obtained by infants delivered vaginally with the occiput the presenting part (average 8.4). Newborns delivered by version and breech extraction had the lowest score (average 6.3). Infants delivered by cesarean section were more vigorous (average score 8.0) when spinal was the method of anesthesia versus an average score of 5.0 when general anesthesia was used. Correlating the 60 s score with neonatal mortality, Virginia found that mature infants receiving 0, 1 or 2 scores had a neonatal death rate of 14\%; those scoring 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 had a death rate of 1.1\%; and those in the 8-10 score group had a death rate of 0.13\%. She concluded that the prognosis of an infant is excellent if he receives one of the upper three scores, and poor if one of the lowest three scores.},

abstract = {Myocardial tagging is a new noninvasive MRI method that allows the study of myocardial motion with high accuracy. However, with conventional tagging techniques tagging contrast is impaired at later heart phases due to longitudinal relaxation. An improved method, called Complementary SPAtial Modulation of Magnetization (CSPAMM), which separates the component of the magnetization with the tagging information from the relaxed component by subtraction of two measurements with first a positive and then a negative tagging grid, is presented. This technique improves the grid contrast and greatly facilitates the automatic evaluation of the myocardial motion. Thus the motion assessment of the entire heart cycle becomes possible. The improvements are documented by numerical simulations and by experiments on phantoms and on human volunteers.},

abstract = {The problem of 2D phase unwrapping arises when a spatially varying quantity is measured module some period. One needs to reconstruct a smooth unwrapped phase, consistent with the original data, by adding a multiple of the period to each sample. Smoothness typically cannot be enforced over all of the scene, due to noise and localized jumps. An unwrapping algorithm may form a mask within which phase discontinuities are allowed. In interferometry a quality map is available, indicating the reliability of the measurements. In this case, the mask should be contained as much as possible in areas of low quality. This paper presents an algorithm for phase unwrapping in which the mask design is guided by the quality map. The mask is grown from the residues (as defined by Goldstein et al.) into areas where the quality is below a threshold. A connected component of the mask stops growing when its residue charge becomes balanced. The threshold is raised as necessary to allow growth. This stage terminates when all components are balanced. The mask is then thinned by removing points that are not needed to cover the residues correctly. The unwrapped phase is found by simple 1D unwrapping along paths that avoid the mask. The authors present an example solution found by the algorithm and discuss possible modifications},

abstract = {Given an interferometric phase image of a surface profile, the task oftwo-dimensional phase unwrapping is to reconstruct the profile by adding multiplesof 2$\pi$ to the image. Discontinuities in the unwrapped phase must be restrictedto areas of noise and true discontinuity in the profile. Such areas can oftenbe identified by their low quality. This suggests that the unwrapped phaseshould be chosen to minimize a weighted sum of discontinuity magnitudes. Analgorithm is presented that computes such an unwrapped phase from any initialguess. The elementary operation of the algorithm is to partition the imageinto two connected regions, then raise the unwrapped phase by 2$\pi$ in oneof the regions, reducing the weighted sum; this is done repeatedly until nosuitable partitions exist. The operations are found by creating paths thatfollow discontinuity curves and extending them to form complete partitions.The algorithm terminates when no path can be extended. The behavior of thealgorithm and the benefits of weighting are illustrated with an example.},

abstract = {The FFTW library for computing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) has gained a wide acceptance in both academia and industry, because it provides excellent performance on a variety of machines (even competitive with or faster than equivalent libraries supplied by vendors). In FFTW, most of the performance-critical code was generated automatically by a special-purpose compiler, called genfft, that outputs C code. Written in Objective Caml,genfft can produce DFT programs for any input length, and it can specialize the DFT program for the common case where the input data are real instead of complex. Unexpectedly,genfft “discovered” algorithms that were previously unknown, and it was able to reduce the arithmetic complexity of some other existing algorithms. This paper describes the internals of this special-purpose compiler in some detail, and it argues that a specialized compiler is a valuable tool.},

METHODS: We enrolled 20 patients with ARVC, 30 with borderline ARVC and 22 subjects with a positive family history but no clinical signs of a manifest ARVC. 10 healthy volunteers (HV) served as controls. 15 ARVC patients received genotyping for Plakophilin-2 mutation (PKP-2), of which 7 were found to be positive. Cine MR datasets of all subjects were assessed for myocardial strain using FT (TomTec Diogenes Software). Global strain and strain rate in radial, circumferential and longitudinal mode were assessed for the right and left ventricle. In addition strain analysis at a segmental level was performed for the right ventricular free wall. RESULTS: RV global longitudinal strain rates in ARVC (-0.68 ± 0.36 sec-1) and borderline ARVC (-0.85 ± 0.36 sec-1) were significantly reduced in comparison with HV (-1.38 ± 0.52 sec-1, p ≤ 0.05). Furthermore, in ARVC patients RV global circumferential strain and strain rates at the basal level were significantly reduced compared with HV (strain: -5.1 ± 2.7 vs. -9.2 ± 3.6\%; strain rate: -0.31 ± 0.13 sec-1 vs. -0.61 ± 0.21 sec-1). Even for patients with ARVC or borderline ARVC and normal RV ejection fraction (n=30) global longitudinal strain rate proved to be significantly reduced compared with HV (-0.9 ± 0.3 vs. -1.4 ± 0.5 sec-1; p < 0.005). In ARVC patients with PKP-2 mutation there was a clear trend towards a more pronounced impairment in RV global longitudinal strain rate. On ROC analysis RV global longitudinal strain rate and circumferential strain rate at the basal level proved to be the best discriminators between ARVC patients and HV (AUC: 0.9 and 0.92, respectively). CONCLUSION: CMR based strain analysis using FT is an objective and useful measure for quantification of wall motion abnormalities in ARVC. It allows differentiation between manifest or borderline ARVC and HV, even if ejection fraction is still normal.},

abstract = {We introduce and evaluate strain mapping by multidetector computer tomography as a new noninvasive method for assessment of myocardial function. In patients (n = 16) with healed myocardial infarction, peak systolic radial strain was measured by automated pixel pattern matching analysis of multiple left ventricular 64-slice multidetector computer tomographic short-axis recordings. For comparison, radial strain and myocardial infarct extent were measured by tagged magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and late enhancement MRI, respectively. In a linear mixed model analysis, myocardial infarct extent was a strong predictor of segmental strain by multidetector computer tomography (beta = -0.44, p <0.0001). Strain was significantly different among noninfarcted (0\%), nontransmurally infarcted (0\% to 50\%), and transmurally infarcted (>50\%) segments (p <0.001) and between infarcted and noninfarcted border zone segments (p <0.001). There was a close relation between strain by multidetector computer tomography and by tagged MRI (mean difference -7.4 +/- 11.7\%, r = 0.68, p <0.0001). Mean time-to-peak systolic strain was 324 +/- 42 ms by multidetector computer tomography and 335 +/- 56 ms by tagged MRI (mean difference 11 +/- 40 ms). In conclusion, to our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate that regional myocardial function can be quantified by multidetector computer tomographic imaging, indicating that assessment of radial strain by multidetector computer tomography might be a useful tool in the evaluation of patients with cardiovascular diseases.},

abstract = {Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is caused by dominant mutations in sarcomere genes. Although the diagnosis of HCM is traditionally based on identifying unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) by cardiac imaging, LVH is not an invariable feature of disease. The expression of LVH is highly age-dependent, and LV wall thickness is typically normal during childhood. Overt cardiac hypertrophy often does not develop until adolescence or later. With genetic testing, family members who have inherited a pathogenic sarcomere mutation (G+) can be identified prior to a clinical diagnosis (LVH-). This allows characterization of a new and important subset, denoted preclinical HCM (G+/LVH-). Although there are no distinguishing morphologic features of early disease, there is evidence of myocardial dysfunction prior to the development of LVH. Otherwise healthy sarcomere mutation carriers frequently have subtle impairment of diastolic function, detectable by tissue Doppler interrogation. These findings can assist in differentiating such at-risk family members from those who did not inherit the mutation, despite the presence of normal LV wall thickness. In contrast, systolic function appears relatively preserved in preclinical HCM but impaired in overt disease, suggesting that both the sarcomere mutation and the characteristic changes in myocardial architecture (LVH, fibrosis, and disarray) are required to perturb force generation. Better characterization of preclinical HCM will identify the initial manifestations of sarcomere mutations, characterize intermediate disease phenotypes, and foster efforts to develop novel therapeutic strategies based on genetic identification of at-risk individuals and early initiation of therapy to prevent disease progression when treatment may be most effective.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genetic testing identifies sarcomere mutation carriers (G+) before clinical diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), allowing characterization of initial disease manifestations. Previous studies demonstrated that impaired relaxation develops before left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The precise impact of sarcomere mutations on systolic function in early and late disease is unclear.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Comprehensive echocardiography with strain imaging was performed on 146 genotyped individuals with mutations in 5 sarcomere genes. Contractile parameters were compared in 68 preclinical (G+/LVH-), 40 overt (G+/LVH+) subjects with HCM, and 38 mutation (-) normal control relatives. All subjects had normal left ventricular ejection fraction. In preclinical HCM, global and regional peak systolic strain (epsilon(sys)) and longitudinal systolic strain rate were not significantly different from controls, but early diastolic mitral annular velocity (Ea) was reduced by 13\%. In overt HCM, there was a significant 27\% and 14\% decrease in global longitudinal epsilon(sys) and systolic strain rate, respectively, compared with both preclinical HCM and controls (P<0.013 for all comparisons), and a 33\% reduction in Ea.

CONCLUSIONS: Sarcomere mutations have disparate initial effects on diastolic and systolic functions. Preclinical HCM is characterized by impaired relaxation but preserved systolic strain. In contrast, both diastolic and longitudinal systolic abnormalities are present in overt disease despite normal ejection fraction. We propose that diastolic dysfunction is an early consequence of sarcomere mutations, whereas systolic dysfunction results from mutations combined with subsequent pathological remodeling. Identifying mechanistic pathways triggered by these mutations may begin to reshape the clinical paradigm for treatment, based on early diagnosis and disease prevention.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: HIV infection continues to be endemic worldwide. Although treatments are successful, it remains controversial whether patients receiving optimal therapy have structural, functional, or biochemical cardiac abnormalities that may underlie their increased cardiac morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this study was to characterize myocardial abnormalities in a contemporary group of HIV-infected individuals undergoing combination antiretroviral therapy.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Volunteers with HIV who were undergoing combination antiretroviral therapy and age-matched control subjects without a history of cardiovascular disease underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy for the determination of cardiac function, myocardial fibrosis, and myocardial lipid content. A total of 129 participants were included in this analysis. Compared with age-matched control subjects (n=39; 30.23\%), HIV-infected subjects undergoing combination antiretroviral therapy (n=90; 69.77\%) had 47\% higher median myocardial lipid levels (P <0.003) and 74\% higher median plasma triglyceride levels (both P<0.001). Myocardial fibrosis, predominantly in the basal inferolateral wall of the left ventricle, was observed in 76\% of HIV-infected subjects compared with 13\% of control subjects (P<0.001). Peak myocardial systolic and diastolic longitudinal strain were also lower in HIV-infected individuals than in control subjects and remained statistically significant after adjustment for available confounders.

CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive cardiac imaging revealed cardiac steatosis, alterations in cardiac function, and a high prevalence of myocardial fibrosis in a contemporary group of asymptomatic HIV-infected subjects undergoing combination antiretroviral therapy. Cardiac steatosis and fibrosis may underlie cardiac dysfunction and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in subjects with HIV.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: An accurate and practical method to measure parameters like strain in myocardial tissue is of great clinical value, since it has been shown, that strain is a more sensitive and earlier marker for contractile dysfunction than the frequently used parameter EF. Current technologies for CMR are time consuming and difficult to implement in clinical practice. Feature tracking is a technology that can lead to more automatization and robustness of quantitative analysis of medical images with less time consumption than comparable methods.

METHODS: An automatic or manual input in a single phase serves as an initialization from which the system starts to track the displacement of individual patterns representing anatomical structures over time. The specialty of this method is that the images do not need to be manipulated in any way beforehand like e.g. tagging of CMR images.

RESULTS: The method is very well suited for tracking muscular tissue and with this allowing quantitative elaboration of myocardium and also blood flow.

CONCLUSIONS: This new method offers a robust and time saving procedure to quantify myocardial tissue and blood with displacement, velocity and deformation parameters on regular sequences of CMR imaging. It therefore can be implemented in clinical practice.},

This paper attempts to review some of the recent developments in the mathematical modeling of IIH field. Low-frequency models are widely used, but they tend to corrupt the low-frequency components of the tissue. Hypersurface models and statistical models can be adaptive to the image and generally more stable, but they are also generally more complex and consume more computer memory and CPU time. They are often formulated together with image segmentation within one framework and the overall performance is highly dependent on the segmentation process. Beside these three popular models, this paper also summarizes other techniques based on different principles. In addition, the issue of quantitative evaluation and comparative study are discussed.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Speckle tracking is the latest available technology in echocardiography. However, the technology is still mainly used as a research tool. The potential applications of speckle tracking are many, including cardiac synchronization, regional wall motion analysis, and in the areas of cardiac mechanic studies. This review presents the background theory of speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) and how this technology can be extended to velocity vector analysis, strain, and torsion measurements. The interpretations of these measurements are covered. We also present some potential applications in the critical care setting.

RECENT FINDINGS: Speckle tracking is almost always available in high-end ultrasound machines. The technology has been applied to velocity vector analysis, strain and strain rate measurements, and twist and torsion analysis. Torsion analysis and velocity vector analyses are impossible without using speckle tracking. Speckle tracking-derived strain is superior to tissue Doppler strain because it is angle-independent. A number of studies demonstrated that STE is useful in left and right heart assessments and can be used in assessing preload and afterload.

SUMMARY: Speckle tracking can be used to measure instantaneous myocardial contractility, strain, and left ventricular torsion. It is still a research tool at present, but shows the promise of being a clinical tool in the future.},

abstract = {AIMS: Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an inherited channelopathy that can be characterized by mild right ventricular (RV) abnormalities that are not detectable with conventional echocardiography. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of RV abnormalities in BrS patients when compared with controls and a group of patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) using two-dimensional (2D) strain analysis.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled 25 BrS, 15 ARVD/C patients, and 25 controls. Right and left ventricular dimension and systo-diastolic function were evaluated by conventional echocardiography. Longitudinal systolic strain (sS) peak, systolic and early diastolic strain rate of lateral RV segments were evaluated by 2D speckle tracking analysis. Left ventricle global and segmental strain measures were also evaluated. A reduced basal or mid-RV lateral sS were the parameters mostly associated with both BrS and ARVD/C. In BrS patients the minimum sS observed in these segments was significantly lower than that of controls (-28.9±3.2\% vs. -32.3±3.2\%, P: 0.002) but significantly greater than that evaluated in ARVD/C patients (-24.6±6.7\%, P<0.001 both vs. BrS and controls). No differences were found between the BrS and the control group when left ventricular strain measures were analysed.

CONCLUSION: By 2D strain technique it is possible to observe mild abnormalities in RV systolic and diastolic function of BrS patients that are less pronounced than those observed in ARVD/C patients. These results help to better define the phenotypic characteristics of BrS patients and represent the basis for future studies aimed at testing their clinical usefulness in BrS patients.},

abstract = {With the developments in ultrasound transducer technology and both hardware and software computing, real-time volumetric imaging has become widely available, accompanied by various methods of assessing three-dimensional (3D) myocardial strain, often referred to as 3D speckle-tracking echocardiographic methods. Indeed, these methods should provide cardiologists with a better view of regional myocardial mechanics, which might be important for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. However, currently available 3D speckle-tracking echocardiographic methods are based on different algorithms, which introduce substantial differences between them and make them not interchangeable with each other. Therefore, it is critical that each 3D speckle-tracking echocardiographic method is validated individually before being introduced into clinical practice. In this review, the authors discuss differences and similarities of the currently available 3D strain estimation approaches and provide an overview of the current status of their validation.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance tagging is used to evaluate the dynamic deformation of lines or grids superimposed on the myocardium during the cardiac cycle. From these data, a specific postprocessing procedure provides two kinds of metrics: (a) three orthogonal components of myocardial motion (longitudinal, circumferential, and radial), and (b) rotation and torsion. Strain expresses the local myocardial deformation and is prone to important physiologic heterogeneities. Peak systolic strain is in the range of -15\% to -20\% for the longitudinal and circumferential components (fiber shortening) and 30\%-40\% for the radial component (wall thickening). The helical arrangement of myofibers that run in opposite directions at the epicardium and endocardium explains systolic twist (\~{}15°). This torsion may be enhanced during the early stage of several diseases (eg, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) or in heart failure with a normal left ventricular ejection fraction. Strain is generally impaired in ischemic heart disease and cardiomyopathy, but the most diagnostically significant finding is the early identification of contractile dysfunction on the basis of longitudinal and circumferential strain reduction in patients with apparently preserved systolic function. Thus, strain impairment appears to be a sensitive and promising marker of subclinical disease, with the potential for improving patient management.},

In the present study, the feasibility of a cine 3D TrueFISP technique in which several complete volumetric measurements may be obtained during a single breathhold is demonstrated. In contrast to 3D FLASH, the TrueFISP sequence offers an excellent contrast between the myocardium and the intraventricular cavity without the use of contrast agent. An ECG-gated 3D cine TrueFISP sequence was implemented with a repetition time of 2.4-2.8 ms, which allows imaging of the complete heart within a single breathhold throughout 20-46 heartbeats with a 3D frame rate of 8-13 volumes per cardiac cycle and a spatial resolution of about 1.5 x 3.5 x 3.5 mm(3). Breathhold volumetric cine imaging with the 3D TrueFISP technique holds promise for rapid and accurate evaluation of the cardiac regional wall motion and the calculation of cardiac volume and ejection fraction.},

@article{Kao2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: We tested the hypothesis that the apical myocardial mechanics differ from those of other ventricular segments in hypertensive patients with and without apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (ApHCM).

METHODS: We retrospectively studied hypertensive patients with and without ApHCM. Left ventricular longitudinal, circumferential, and radial strains were examined by two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography at the basal, middle, and apical walls of the parasternal short-axis and apical 2-, 3- and 4-chamber views.

RESULTS: Fourteen consecutive patients with hypertension and ApHCM and 14 patients with hypertension without ApHCM were studied. Lower mitral annular peak systolic velocity and greater diastolic dysfunction were present in hypertensive patients with ApHCM than in hypertensive patients without ApHCM. Compared with hypertensive patients without ApHCM, hypertensive patients with ApHCM had significantly lower apical longitudinal (-13.9\% vs -21.9\%, p = 0.010) and radial strains (4.4\% vs 11.5\%, p = 0.017) without the base-to-apex gradient. The global longitudinal (-15.6\% vs -18.8\%, p = 0.027) and circumferential strains (-16.1\% vs -19.2\%, p = 0.019) were significantly lower in hypertensive patients with ApHCM than in hypertensive patients without ApHCM. Among systolic parameters, the global longitudinal strain was independently associated with hypertension with ApHCM (odds ratio, 1.457; 95\% confidence interval, 1.002--2.119; p = 0.049).

CONCLUSIONS: Reduced apical longitudinal and radial strains without a base-to-apex gradient were present in hypertensive patients with ApHCM. The global longitudinal strain was independently associated with ApHCM in hypertensive patients.},

abstract = {Many applications that rely on phase data, such as: synthetic aperture radar (SAR), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and interferometry involve solving the two- dimensional phase unwrapping problem. The phase unwrapping problem has been tackled by a number of researchers who have attempted to solve it in many ways. This thesis examines the phase unwrapping problem from two perspectives. Firstly it develops two new techniques based upon the principles of Genetic Algorithms. Secondly it examines the reasons for failure of most of the common existing algorithms and proposes a new approach to ensuring the robustness of the phase unwrapping process. This new method can be used in conjunction of a number of algorithms including, but not limited to, the two Genetic Algorithm methods developed here. Some research effort has been devoted to solving the phase unwrapping problem using artificial intelligence methods. Recent developments in artificial intelligence have led to the creation of the Hybrid Genetic Algorithm approach which has not previously been applied to the phase unwrapping problem. Two hybrid genetic algorithm methods for solving the two dimensional phase unwrapping problem are proposed and developed in this thesis. The performance of these two algorithms is subsequently compared with several existing methods of phase unwrapping. The most robust existing phase unwrapping techniques use exhaustive computations and approximations, but these approaches contribute little towards understanding the cause of failure in the phase unwrapping process. This work undertakes a thorough investigation to the phase unwrapping problem especially with regard to the problem of residues. This investigation has identified a new feature in the wrapped phase data, which has been named the residue-vector. This residue-vector is generated by the presence of a residue, it has an orientation that points out towards the balancing residue of opposite polarity and it can be used to guide the manner in which branch-cuts are placed in phase unwrapping. Also, the residue-vector can be used for the determination of the weighting values used in different existing phase unwrapping methods such as minimum cost flow and least squares. In this work, the theoretical foundations of the residue-vector method are presented and a residue-vector extraction method is developed and implemented. This technique is then demonstrated both as an unwrapping tool and as an objective method for determining a quality map, using only the data in the wrapped phase map itself. Finally a general comparison is made between the residue-vector map and other existing quality map generation methods.},

abstract = {The diagnosis of cardiovascular disease requires precise assessment of both morphology and function of the heart. Currently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a useful tool for accurate and reproducible assessment of regional function of the left ventricle noninvasively. MR tagging produces images of the heart that can be analyzed using harmonic phase (HARP) method to describe the regional function of the heart. In order to calculate regional function, a circular mesh is manually built at a specific timeframe, after which the points of such mesh are tracked using the HARP technique. The tracking is not perfect and some individual points on the mesh could fail in tracking. In this work, a new method is presented to improve the tracking by combining HARP with active contour methods. This modified HARP technique is more robust than the previous HARP technique.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is histopathologically characterized by myocyte hypertrophy, disarray, interstitial fibrosis, and small intramural coronary arteriole dysplasia, which contribute to disease progression. Longitudinal systolic and early diastolic strain rate (SR) measurements by speckle tracking echocardiography are sensitive markers of regional myocardial function. We sought to determine the association between septal SR and histopathologic findings in symptomatic HCM patients who underwent surgical myectomy.

METHODS: We studied 171 HCM patients (documented on histopathology) who underwent surgical myectomy to relieve left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Various clinical and echocardiographic parameters were recorded. Segmental longitudinal systolic and early diastolic SRs (of the septal segment removed at myectomy) were measured from apical 4- and 2-chamber views (VVI 2.0; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Histopathologic myocyte hypertrophy, disarray, small intramural coronary arteriole dysplasia, and interstitial fibrosis were classified as none, mild (1\%-25\%), moderate (26\%-50\%), and severe (>50\%).

RESULTS: The mean age was 53 ± 14 years (52\% men, ejection fraction 62\% ± 5\%, mean left ventricular outflow tract gradient 102 ± 39 mm Hg, and basal septal thickness of 2.2 ± 0.5 cm). Mean longitudinal systolic and early diastolic SRs were -0.91 ± 0.5 and 0.82 ± 0.5 (1/s), respectively. There was an inverse association between systolic and early diastolic septal SR and degree of myocyte hypertrophy, disarray, and interstitial fibrosis (all P < .05). There was no association between histopathologic characteristics and other echocardiography parameters. On multivariable regression analysis, myocyte disarray and echocardiographic septal hypertrophy were associated with systolic and early diastolic septal SR (P < .05).

CONCLUSION: In HCM patients, there is inverse association between various histopathologic findings and septal SR. Strain rate might potentially provide further insight into HCM pathophysiology.},

abstract = {There are many applications such as stereo matching, mo- tion tracking and image registration that require so called ‘corners’ to be detected across image sequences in a reliable manner. The Harris cor- ner detector is widely used for this purpose. However, the response from the Harris operator, and other corner operators, varies considerably with image contrast. This makes the setting of thresholds that are appropri- ate for extended image sequences difficult, if not impossible. This paper describes a new corner and edge detector developed from the phase con- gruency model of feature detection. The new operator uses the principal moments of the phase congruency information to determine corner and edge information. The resulting corner and edge operator is highly local- ized and has responses that are invariant to image contrast. This results in reliable feature detection under varying illumination conditions with fixed thresholds. An additional feature of the operator is that the corner map is a strict subset of the edge map. This facilitates the cooperative use of corner and edge information.},

abstract = {The serum anion gap, calculated from the electrolytes measured in the chemical laboratory, is defined as the sum of serum chloride and bicarbonate concentrations subtracted from the serum sodium concentration. This entity is used in the detection and analysis of acid-base disorders, assessment of quality control in the chemical laboratory, and detection of such disorders as multiple myeloma, bromide intoxication, and lithium intoxication. The normal value can vary widely, reflecting both differences in the methods that are used to measure its constituents and substantial interindividual variability. Low values most commonly indicate laboratory error or hypoalbuminemia but can denote the presence of a paraproteinemia or intoxication with lithium, bromide, or iodide. Elevated values most commonly indicate metabolic acidosis but can reflect laboratory error, metabolic alkalosis, hyperphosphatemia, or paraproteinemia. Metabolic acidosis can be divided into high anion and normal anion gap varieties, which can be present alone or concurrently. A presumed 1:1 stoichiometry between change in the serum anion gap (DeltaAG) and change in the serum bicarbonate concentration (DeltaHCO(3)(-)) has been used to uncover the concurrence of mixed metabolic acid-base disorders in patients with high anion gap acidosis. However, recent studies indicate variability in the DeltaAG/DeltaHCO(3)(-) in this disorder. This observation undercuts the ability to use this ratio alone to detect complex acid-base disorders, thus emphasizing the need to consider additional information to obtain the appropriate diagnosis. Despite these caveats, calculation of the serum anion gap remains an inexpensive and effective tool that aids detection of various acid-base disorders, hematologic malignancies, and intoxications.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reduced long-axis shortening despite enhanced global function has been reported in aortic stenosis. We sought to improve the understanding of this phenomenon using multi-dimensional strain analysis in conjunction with the evaluation of left ventricular rotation and twist - ventricular torsion - using tissue Doppler techniques. METHODS: A total of 57 patients with variable severity of aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, or mixed aortic valve disease, subdivided into six groups, were studied. Ventricular morphology was assessed using long-axis/short-axis and mass/volume ratios, afterload using end-systolic meridional wall stress, and global performance using ejection fraction. The circumferential and longitudinal strain was measured from two-dimensional images, and left ventricular rotation and twist were estimated as the difference in rotation between the base and apex of the ventricle. RESULTS: Aortic stenosis was associated with higher mass/volume, ejection fraction, circumferential strain and left ventricular rotation and twist, significantly lower end-systolic wall stress, and a trend towards lower longitudinal strain compared with normal. Myocardial mechanics in aortic regurgitation were normal despite ventricular dilation. Mixed aortic valve disease showed findings similar to aortic stenosis. Left ventricular rotation and twist correlated with midwall circumferential strain (r = 0.62 and p < 0.0001), endocardial circumferential strain (r = 0.61 and p < 0.0001), and end-systolic wall stress (r = 0.48 and p < 0.0001), but not with longitudinal strain (r = 0.18 and p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial mechanics are normal in patients with aortic regurgitation, independent of abnormalities in cardiac geometry. Conversely, in aortic stenosis and mixed aortic valve disease, significant alterations in the patterns of fibre shortening are found. The effects of stenosis on cardiac function seem to dominate the effect of ventricular remodelling.},

abstract = {Tagged cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) imaging can non-invasively image deformation of the left ventricular (LV) wall. Three-dimensional (3D) analysis of tag data requires fitting a deformation model to tag lines in the image data. In this paper, we present a 3D myocardial displacement and strain reconstruction method based on a B-spline deformation model defined in prolate spheroidal coordinates, which more closely matches the shape of the LV wall than existing Cartesian or cylindrical coordinate models. The prolate spheroidal B-spline (PSB) deformation model also enforces smoothness across and can compute strain at the apex. The PSB reconstruction algorithm was evaluated on a previously published data set to allow head-to-head comparison of the PSB model with existing LV deformation reconstruction methods. We conclude that the PSB method can accurately reconstruct deformation and strain in the LV wall from tagged MR images and has several advantages relative to existing techniques.},

abstract = {Image phase from gradient echo MRI provides a unique contrast that reflects brain tissue composition variations, such as iron and myelin distribution. Phase imaging is emerging as a powerful tool for the investigation of functional brain anatomy and disease diagnosis. However, the quantitative value of phase is compromised by its nonlocal and orientation dependent properties. There is an increasing need for reliable quantification of magnetic susceptibility, the intrinsic property of tissue. In this study, we developed a novel and accurate susceptibility mapping method that is also phase-wrap insensitive. The proposed susceptibility mapping method utilized two complementary equations: (1) the Fourier relationship of phase and magnetic susceptibility; and (2) the first-order partial derivative of the first equation in the spatial frequency domain. In numerical simulation, this method reconstructed the susceptibility map almost free of streaking artifact. Further, the iterative implementation of this method allowed for high quality reconstruction of susceptibility maps of human brain in vivo. The reconstructed susceptibility map provided excellent contrast of iron-rich deep nuclei and white matter bundles from surrounding tissues. Further, it also revealed anisotropic magnetic susceptibility in brain white matter. Hence, the proposed susceptibility mapping method may provide a powerful tool for the study of brain physiology and pathophysiology. Further elucidation of anisotropic magnetic susceptibility in vivo may allow us to gain more insight into the white matter micro-architectures.},

The 12-lead electrocardiogram may be normal or have T-wave inversion beyond V(1) in an otherwise healthy person who is suspected of having ARVC. The most frequent imaging abnormalities are an enlarged right ventricle, decrease in right ventricular (RV) function, and localized wall motion abnormalities. Risk factors for implantable cardioverter defibrillator include a history of aborted sudden death, syncope, young age, decreased left ventricular function, and marked decrease in RV function.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 1994, an International Task Force proposed criteria for the clinical diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D) that facilitated recognition and interpretation of the frequently nonspecific clinical features of ARVC/D. This enabled confirmatory clinical diagnosis in index cases through exclusion of phenocopies and provided a standard on which clinical research and genetic studies could be based. Structural, histological, electrocardiographic, arrhythmic, and familial features of the disease were incorporated into the criteria, subdivided into major and minor categories according to the specificity of their association with ARVC/D. At that time, clinical experience with ARVC/D was dominated by symptomatic index cases and sudden cardiac death victims-the overt or severe end of the disease spectrum. Consequently, the 1994 criteria were highly specific but lacked sensitivity for early and familial disease.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Revision of the diagnostic criteria provides guidance on the role of emerging diagnostic modalities and advances in the genetics of ARVC/D. The criteria have been modified to incorporate new knowledge and technology to improve diagnostic sensitivity, but with the important requisite of maintaining diagnostic specificity. The approach of classifying structural, histological, electrocardiographic, arrhythmic, and genetic features of the disease as major and minor criteria has been maintained. In this modification of the Task Force criteria, quantitative criteria are proposed and abnormalities are defined on the basis of comparison with normal subject data.

CONCLUSIONS: The present modifications of the Task Force Criteria represent a working framework to improve the diagnosis and management of this condition.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prior reports on patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D) focused on individuals with advanced forms of the disease. Data on the diagnostic performance of various testing modalities in newly identified individuals suspected of having ARVC/D are limited. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the Multidisciplinary Study of Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy/Dysplasia was to study the clinical characteristics and diagnostic evaluation of a large group of patients newly identified with ARVC/D. METHODS: A total of 108 newly diagnosed patients with suspected ARVC/D were prospectively enrolled in the United States and Canada. The patients underwent noninvasive and invasive tests using standardized protocols that initially were interpreted by the enrolling center and adjudicated by blind analysis in six core laboratories. Patients were followed for a mean of 27 +/- 16 months (range 0.2-63 months). RESULTS: The clinical profile of these newly diagnosed patients differs from the profile of reported patients with more advanced disease. There was considerable difference in the initial and final classification of the presence of ARVC/D after the diagnostic tests were evaluated by the core laboratories. Final clinical diagnosis was 73 affected, 28 borderline, and 7 unaffected. Individual tests agreed with the final diagnosis in 50\% to 70\% of the 73 patients with a final classification of affected. CONCLUSION: The clinical profile of 108 newly diagnosed probands with suspected ARVC/D indicates that a combination of diagnostic tests is needed to evaluate the presence of right ventricular structural, functional, and electrical abnormalities. Echocardiography, right ventricular angiography, signal-averaged ECG, and Holter monitoring provide optimal clinical evaluation of patients suspected of ARVC/D.},

To identify optimal imaging parameters data acquisition was repeated for different flip angles. Left ventricular tag-tissue contrast, tag fading times, tag persistence, and myocardial signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were quantified in basal, mid-ventricular, and apical slice locations. To assess the effect of field strength on image quality and artifact level, additional semiquantitative image grading was performed by two experienced readers. SSFP-tagging at 3T proved superior to 1.5T and provided significantly enhanced tag persistence and myocardial SNR while maintaining overall image quality and artifact level. The definition of a tag quality index demonstrated optimal SSFP-tagging performance for a flip angle of 20 degrees . Diastolic tag visibility was improved at 3T and resulted in enhanced average tag persistence of 789 +/- 128 ms compared to 523 +/- 40 ms at 1.5T. For SSFP-tagging at 3T the combination of T(1) lengthening and superior myocardial SNR is highly promising and has the potential to improve the depiction of tagged myocardial function throughout the entire cardiac cycle.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Our purpose was to characterize the pattern and distribution of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) to more precisely define phenotypic expression and its clinical implications in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).

BACKGROUND: Based on prior pathologic and 2-dimensional echocardiographic studies, HCM has been regarded as a disease characterized by substantial LV wall thickening.

METHODS: Cine and late gadolinium enhancement CMR were performed in 333 consecutive HCM patients (age 43 +/- 17 years).

RESULTS: Basal anterior LV free wall and the contiguous anterior ventricular septum were the most commonly hypertrophied segments (n = 256; 77\%). LV hypertrophy was focal (involving < or = 2 segments [< or = 12\% of LV]) in 41 patients (12\%), intermediate (3 to 7 segments [13\% to 49\% of LV]) in 112 patients (34\%), and diffuse (> or = 8 segments [> or = 50\% of LV]) in 180 patients (54\%); 42 patients (13\%) showed hypertrophied segments separated by regions of normal thickness. The number of hypertrophied segments was greater in patients with LV outflow tract obstruction (> or = 30 mm Hg) than without (10 +/- 4 vs. 8 +/- 4 per patient; p = 0.0001) and was associated with an advanced New York Heart Association functional class (p = 0.007). LV wall thickness was greater in segments with late gadolinium enhancement than without (20 +/- 6 mm vs. 16 +/- 6 mm; p < 0.001). We also identified 40 (12\%) of HCM patients with segmental LV hypertrophy largely confined to the anterolateral free wall, posterior septum, or apex, which was underestimated or undetected by echocardiography.

CONCLUSIONS: Although diverse, patterns of LV hypertrophy are usually not extensive in HCM, involving < or = 50\% of the chamber in about one-half the patients, and are particularly limited in extent in an important minority. Contiguous portions of anterior free wall and septum constituted the predominant region of wall thickening, with implications for clinical diagnosis. These observations support an emerging role for CMR in the contemporary evaluation of patients with HCM.},

Two major modifications of conventional Look-Locker (LL) imaging are introduced: 1) selective data acquisition, and 2) merging of data from multiple LL experiments into one data set. Each modified LL inversion recovery (MOLLI) study consisted of three successive LL inversion recovery (IR) experiments with different inversion times. We acquired images in late diastole using a single-shot steady-state free-precession (SSFP) technique, combined with sensitivity encoding to achieve a data acquisition window of < 200 ms duration. We calculated T1 using signal intensities from regions of interest and pixel by pixel. T1 accuracy at different heart rates derived from simulated ECG signals was tested in phantoms. T1 estimates showed small systematic error for T1 values from 191 to 1196 ms. In vivo T1 mapping was performed in two healthy volunteers and in one patient with acute myocardial infarction before and after administration of Gd-DTPA. T1 values for myocardium and noncardiac structures were in good agreement with values available from the literature. The region of infarction was clearly visualized. MOLLI provides high-resolution T1 maps of human myocardium in native and post-contrast situations within a single breath-hold.},

abstract = {The authors have developed a technique based on a solution of the Poisson equation to unwrap the phase in magnetic resonance (MR) phase images. The method is based on the assumption that the magnitude of the inter-pixel phase change is less than pi per pixel. Therefore, the authors obtain an estimate of the phase gradient by "wrapping" the gradient of the original phase image. The problem is then to obtain the absolute phase given the estimate of the phase gradient. The least-squares (LS) solution to this problem is shown to be a solution of the Poisson equation allowing the use of fast Poisson solvers. The absolute phase is then obtained by mapping the LS phase to the nearest multiple of 2 K from the measured phase. The proposed technique is evaluated using MR phase images and is proven to be robust in the presence of noise. An application of the proposed method to the 3-point Dixon technique for water and fat separation is demonstrated.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To present a database of systolic three-dimensional (3D) strain evolution throughout the normal left ventricle (LV) in humans.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 31 healthy volunteers, magnetic resonance (MR) tissue tagging and breath-hold MR imaging were used to generate and then detect the motion of transient fiducial markers (ie, tags) in the heart every 32 msec. Strain and motion were calculated from a 3D displacement field that was fit to the tag data. Special indexes of contraction and thickening that were based on multiple strain components also were evaluated.

RESULTS: The temporal evolution of local strains was linear during the first half of systole. The peak shortening and thickening strain components were typically greatest in the anterolateral wall, increased toward the apex, and increased toward the endocardium. Shears and displacements were more spatially variable. The two specialized indexes of contraction and thickening had higher measurement precision and tighter normal ranges than did the traditional strain components.

CONCLUSION: In this study, the authors noninvasively characterized the normal systolic ranges of 3D displacement and strain evolution throughout the human LV. Comparison against this multidimensional database may permit sensitive detection of systolic LV dysfunction.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Septal myectomy for symptomatic patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is a well-established procedure for symptomatic relief. Myocardial mechanics are abnormal in patients with HOCM, demonstrating low longitudinal strain, high circumferential strain, and high apical rotation compared with healthy subjects. The aim of this study was to determine whether functional improvement after myectomy is associated with improved myocardial mechanics.

METHODS: Clinical data and paired echocardiographic studies before and after myectomy (6-18 months) were retrospectively analyzed and compared in 66 patients (mean age, 54 ± 13 years; 64\% men) with HOCM. Myocardial mechanics including longitudinal and circumferential strain and rotation were assessed using two-dimensional strain software (Velocity Vector Imaging).

RESULTS: Patients had significant symptomatic alleviation (mean New York Heart Association class, 2.8 ± 0.4 at baseline and 1.3 ± 0.5 after myectomy; P < .05). Left ventricular outflow gradient decreased dramatically (from 93 ± 26 to 17 ± 12 mm Hg; P < .05), and left atrial volume index decreased (from 48 ± 16 to 37 ± 13 cm(3)/m(2); P < .05). Low longitudinal strain decreased at the myectomy site, increased in the lateral segments, and remained unchanged globally (-16 ± 4). High circumferential strain decreased (from -31 ± 5 to -25 ± 6, P < .05). High left ventricular twist normalized (from -15.5 ± 6.2° to 12.8 ± 4.2°, P < .05). Independent predictors of symptomatic response included younger age before myectomy, thinner posterior wall, and higher lateral early diastolic velocity (e').

CONCLUSION: In patients with HOCM, surgical myectomy alleviated symptoms, relieved obstruction, and decreased left atrial volume index. Longitudinal strain remained unchanged, but circumferential strain and rotation decreased, demonstrating different mechanical adaptations to chronic elevated afterload seen in patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing valve replacement. Disease extent (age, posterior wall involvement) and the presence of diastolic dysfunction seem to be related to partial symptomatic response to myectomy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance myocardial feature tracking (CMR-FT) is a recently described method of post processing routine cine acquisitions which aims to provide quantitative measurements of circumferentially and radially directed ventricular wall strain. Inter-study reproducibility is important for serial assessments however has not been defined for CMR-FT.

METHODS: 16 healthy volunteers were imaged 3 times within a single day. The first examination was performed at 0900 after fasting and was immediately followed by the second. The third, non-fasting scan, was performed at 1400.CMR-FT measures of segmental and global strain parameters were calculated. Left ventricular (LV) circumferential and radial strain were determined in the short axis orientation (Ecc(SAX) and Err(SAX) respectively). LV and right ventricular longitudinal strain and LV radial strain were determined from the 4-chamber orientation (Ell(LV), Ell(RV), and Err(LAX) respectively). LV volumes and function were also analysed.Inter-study reproducibility and study sample sizes required to demonstrate 5\% changes in absolute strain were determined by comparison of the first and second exams. The third exam was used to determine whether diurnal variation affected reproducibility.

RESULTS: CMR-FT strain analysis inter-study reproducibility was variable. Global strain assessment was more reproducible than segmental analysis. Overall Ecc(SAX) was the most reproducible measure of strain: coefficient of variation (CV) 38\% and 20.3\% and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.68 (0.55-0.78) and 0.7 (0.32-0.89) for segmental and global analysis respectively. The least reproducible segmental measure was Ell(RV): CV 60\% and ICC 0.56 (0.41-0.69) whilst the least reproducible global measure was Err(LAX): CV 33.3\% and ICC 0.44 (0-0.77). Variable reproducibility was also reflected in the calculated sample sizes, which ranged from 11 (global Ecc(SAX)) to 156 subjects (segmental Ell(RV)). The reproducibility of LV volumes and function was excellent. There was no diurnal variation in global strain or LV volumetric measurements.

CONCLUSIONS: Inter-study reproducibility of CMR-FT varied between different parameters, as summarized above and was better for global rather than segmental analysis. It was not measurably affected by diurnal variation. CMR-FT may have potential for quantitative wall motion analysis with applications in patient management and clinical trials. However, inter-study reproducibility was relatively poor for segmental and long axis analyses of strain, which have yet to be validated, and may benefit from further development.},

Approximately 50-60\% of ARVD/C patient will have an identifiable pathogenic mutation in one of seven genes associated with the cardiac desmosome and other cardiac pathways. Genetic counseling remains complicated, however, because of great variable expressivity and reduced penetrance, even within members of the same family. Diagnosis of ARVD/C is made by meeting a set of major and minor diagnostic criteria, revised in 2010. Despite this, misdiagnosis is a chronic problem. Management of ARVD/C is aimed at reducing risk of sudden death/arrhythmias and preventing progression of disease. Strenuous physical activity is increasingly recognized as a significant risk factor in disease presentation and progression and is an important factor in preventative management. Anticipation of the psychosocial implications of this disease is also an important aspect of patient management. This review presents an overview of the clinical diagnosis, management, as well as disease mechanism and genetics of this rare cardiomyopathy.},

abstract = {Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common genetic disease of the heart. HCM is characterized by a wide range of clinical expression, ranging from asymptomatic mutation carriers to sudden cardiac death as the first manifestation of the disease. Over 1000 mutations have been identified, classically in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins. Noninvasive imaging is central to the diagnosis of HCM and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is increasingly used to characterize morphologic, functional and tissue abnormalities associated with HCM. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the clinical, pathological and imaging features relevant to understanding the diagnosis of HCM. The early and overt phenotypic expression of disease that may be identified by CMR is reviewed. Diastolic dysfunction may be an early marker of the disease, present in mutation carriers prior to the development of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Late gadolinium enhancement by CMR is present in approximately 60\% of HCM patients with LVH and may provide novel information regarding risk stratification in HCM. It is likely that integrating genetic advances with enhanced phenotypic characterization of HCM with novel CMR techniques will importantly improve our understanding of this complex disease.},

abstract = {A novel 2-dimensional (2-D) echocardiographic tracking method enables the automated tracking of displacement between 2 points of interest in echocardiographic images. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether this 2-D tracking method could be used to measure left ventricular (LV) wall thickness and percent systolic wall thickening (\%WT) in parasternal short-axis views, in comparison with conventional manual measurement, and to determine whether this system can be used to quantitatively assess regional LV wall motion in echocardiography. In 24 subjects (12 with LV wall motion abnormalities), 6 segments in the short-axis images were assessed by this method. Two sample points at the endocardium and epicardium were tracked automatically during 1 cardiac cycle. Then, LV wall thickness and \%WT were calculated. In 50 subjects (32 with LV wall motion abnormalities), average \%WT as an average of all \%WT in every degree of angle in each of the 6 segments was measured by this method, and the results were compared with the visual assessment of LV wall motion scores. There was excellent agreement between the 2-D tracking and manual methods for LV wall thickness (r = 0.99) and \%WT (r = 0.97). The mean differences in LV wall thickness and \%WT were 0.1 +/- 0.4 mm and 0 +/- 5.4\%, respectively. Average \%WT was significantly decreased in the regions of hypokinetic or akinetic wall motion compared with those of normal motion (18 +/- 4\% and 4 +/- 4\% vs 39 +/- 10\%, p <0.001). In conclusion, this 2-D tracking method can be used for the noninvasive, automated quantitation of LV wall motion in 2-D echocardiography.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction may be changing as a result of changes in population demographics and in the prevalence and treatment of risk factors for heart failure. Changes in the prevalence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction may contribute to changes in the natural history of heart failure. We performed a study to define secular trends in the prevalence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction among patients at a single institution over a 15-year period.

METHODS: We studied all consecutive patients hospitalized with decompensated heart failure at Mayo Clinic Hospitals in Olmsted County, Minnesota, from 1987 through 2001. We classified patients as having either preserved or reduced ejection fraction. The patients were also classified as community patients (Olmsted County residents) or referral patients. Secular trends in the type of heart failure, associated cardiovascular disease, and survival were defined.

RESULTS: A total of 6076 patients with heart failure were discharged over the 15-year period; data on ejection fraction were available for 4596 of these patients (76 percent). Of these, 53 percent had a reduced ejection fraction and 47 percent had a preserved ejection fraction. The proportion of patients with the diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction increased over time and was significantly higher among community patients than among referral patients (55 percent vs. 45 percent). The prevalence rates of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes among patients with heart failure increased significantly over time. Survival was slightly better among patients with preserved ejection fraction (adjusted hazard ratio for death, 0.96; P=0.01). Survival improved over time for those with reduced ejection fraction but not for those with preserved ejection fraction.

CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction increased over a 15-year period, while the rate of death from this disorder remained unchanged. These trends underscore the importance of this growing public health problem.},

abstract = {A technique for fast imaging of regional myocardial function using a spiral acquisition in combination with strain-encoded (SENC) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is presented in this paper. This technique, which is termed fast-SENC, enables scan durations as short as a single heartbeat. A reduced field of view (FOV) without foldover artifacts was achieved by localized SENC, which selectively excited the region around the heart. The two images required for SENC imaging (low- and high-tuning) were acquired in an interleaved fashion throughout the cardiac cycle to further shorten the scan time. Regional circumferential contraction and longitudinal shortening of both the left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV) were examined in long- and short-axis views, respectively. The in vivo results obtained from five human subjects and five infarcted dogs are presented. The results of the fast-SENC technique in a single heartbeat acquisition were comparable to those obtained by conventional SENC in a long acquisition time. Therefore, fast-SENC may prove useful for imaging during stress or arrhythmia.},

abstract = {During the past years, multi-detector row CT (MDCT) has evolved into clinical practice with a rapid increase of the number of detector slices. Today's 64 slice CT systems allow whole-body examinations with sub-millimeter resolution in short scan times. As an alternative to adding even more detector slices, we describe the system concept and design of a CT scanner with two X-ray tubes and two detectors (mounted on a CT gantry with a mechanical offset of 90 degrees) that has the potential to overcome limitations of conventional MDCT systems, such as temporal resolution for cardiac imaging. A dual source CT (DSCT) scanner provides temporal resolution equivalent to a quarter of the gantry rotation time, independent of the patient's heart rate (83 ms at 0.33 s rotation time). In addition to the benefits for cardiac scanning, it allows to go beyond conventional CT imaging by obtaining dual energy information if the two tubes are operated at different voltages. Furthermore, we discuss how both acquisition systems can be used to add the power reserve of two X-ray tubes for long scan ranges and obese patients. Finally, future advances of DSCT are highlighted.},

This paper is a review of fully and semi-automated methods performing segmentation in short axis images using a cardiac cine MRI sequence. Medical background and specific segmentation difficulties associated to these images are presented. For this particularly complex segmentation task, prior knowledge is required. We thus propose an original categorization for cardiac segmentation methods, with a special emphasis on what level of external information is required (weak or strong) and how it is used to constrain segmentation. After reviewing method principles and analyzing segmentation results, we conclude with a discussion and future trends in this field regarding methodological and medical issues.},

abstract = {Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) is a heritable cardiomyopathy characterized by the fibrofatty replacement of right ventricular (RV) myocardium leading to RV failure and arrhythmias. This study evaluated the potential utility of tissue Doppler echocardiography (TDE) and strain echocardiography (SE) to quantitatively assess RV function and their potential role in diagnosing ARVD. Images of 30 patients with ARVD (diagnosed by task force criteria) and 36 healthy controls were obtained. Peak systolic velocity, early diastolic velocity, displacement, strain rate, strain, outflow tract diameter, and fractional RV area change were measured in all subjects. Peak RV systolic velocity (6.4 +/- 2.2 vs 9 +/- 1.6 cm/s, p <0.0001), early diastolic velocity (-6.7 +/- 2.7 vs -9.4 +/- 2 cm/s, p <0.0001), displacement (13.7 +/- 5.8 vs 18.7 +/- 3.5 mm, p <0.0003), strain rate (-1 +/- 0.7 vs -2 +/- 1 s(-1), p = 0.002), and strain (-10 +/- 6\% vs -28 +/- 11\%, p = 0.001) were significantly lower in patients with ARVD compared with controls, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity, respectively, were 67\% and 89\% for systolic velocity, 77\% and 71\% for displacement, 73\% and 87\% for strain, 50\% and 96\% for strain rate, 53\% and 93\% for outflow tract diameter, and 47\% and 83\% for fractional area change. RV systolic velocity and displacement were significantly lower than in controls, even in the subset of patients with ARVD with apparently normal right ventricles by conventional echocardiography. Inter- and intraobserver agreement was high. In conclusion, TDE and SE enable the detection of ARVD via the quantification of RV function and may have potential clinical value in the assessment of patients with suspected ARVD. Peak RV systolic velocity <7.5 cm/s and peak RV strain <18\% best identify patients with ARVD.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a novel tag removal method for tagged cardiac MR images. This method is based on a 2D band- stop filtering technique, which selectively attenuates the tag pattern’s frequency components in the spatial-frequency do- main. To automatically design the band-stop filter, we de- veloped a mean shift-based clustering method to partition the power spectrum image into several harmonic regions. Then a principal component analysis-based multivariate fitting pro- cedure is implemented to model the harmonic peak. We have tested this tag removal method on a variety of tagged car- diacMRimages with different imaging settings, which turned to be robust and computationally modest. Comparing with previous tag removal methods [1, 2], the results of this new method are more consistent with the original image’s appear- ance, and can recover more detailed structures, such as the papillary muscles. Based on the new tag-removed images, we have tested segmenting the left ventricular endocardium and papillary muscles using a conventional segmentation method, and achieved better performance than using the previous tag removal method [1, 2].},

The prognostic significance of the stage remained even after adjustment was made for age and sex. However, both sex and age were shown to be poor predictors of survival after adjustment for stage. The method of staging proved to be a reliable predictor of survival whether used at diagnosis or during the course of the disease. The proposed staging system was an equally accurate indicator for survival when applied to two other previously published studies of large series of patients},

abstract = {Real-time 3D echocardiography (RT3DE) promises a more objective and complete cardiac functional analysis by dynamic 3D image acquisition. Despite several efforts towards automation of left ventricle (LV) segmentation and tracking, these remain challenging research problems due to the poor-quality nature of acquired images usually containing missing anatomical information, speckle noise, and limited field-of-view (FOV). Recently, multi-view fusion 3D echocardiography has been introduced as acquiring multiple conventional single-view RT3DE images with small probe movements and fusing them together after alignment. This concept of multi-view fusion helps to improve image quality and anatomical information and extends the FOV. We now take this work further by comparing single-view and multi-view fused images in a systematic study. In order to better illustrate the differences, this work evaluates image quality and information content of single-view and multi-view fused images using image-driven LV endocardial segmentation and tracking. The image-driven methods were utilized to fully exploit image quality and anatomical information present in the image, thus purposely not including any high-level constraints like prior shape or motion knowledge in the analysis approaches. Experiments show that multi-view fused images are better suited for LV segmentation and tracking, while relatively more failures and errors were observed on single-view images.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The clinical diagnosis of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is usually made on the basis of the physical examination, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram. Making an accurate diagnosis can be particularly difficult in children, who may not have cardiac hypertrophy until adulthood. Recently, we demonstrated that mutations in the cardiac myosin heavy-chain genes cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in some families. We report a diagnostic test for familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that relies on the detection of mutations in the beta myosin heavy-chain gene in circulating lymphocytes that we used to evaluate three generations of a family, including the children. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using the polymerase chain reaction, we found that normal and mutant beta cardiac myosin heavy-chain genes are transcribed in circulating lymphocytes. This allowed us to examine beta cardiac myosin heavy-chain messenger RNA from blood lymphocytes, even though ordinary expression of the gene is virtually restricted to the heart. Base sequences amplified from this messenger RNA were analyzed with a ribonuclease protection assay to identify small deletions, abnormal splicing, or missense mutations. Using this technique we identified a novel missense mutation in a patient with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We evaluated 15 of the patient's adult relatives and found perfect agreement with the clinical diagnosis (8 affected and 7 not affected). Clinical analysis of 14 of the children (age, 1 to 20 years) of these affected family members revealed 1 child with echocardiographic findings diagnostic of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, genetic analyses showed that six other children had also inherited the missense mutation and might later manifest the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Transcripts of beta cardiac myosin heavy-chain gene can be detected in blood lymphocytes and used to screen for mutations that cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This approach makes practical the identification of mutations responsible for this disorder and may be applicable to other diseases in which direct analysis is difficult because the mutated gene is expressed only in certain tissues. Preclinical or prenatal screening in an affected family will make it possible to study the disease longitudinally and to develop preventive interventions.},

To capture the complex 3D cardiac motion pattern, multiple 2D tagged slices are usually acquired in different orientations. These approaches are prone to slice misregistration and associated with long acquisition times. In this work, a fast method for acquiring 3D CSPAMM data is proposed that allows measuring deformation of the whole heart in three breath-holds of 18 heartbeats duration each. Three acquisitions are sequentially performed with line tag preparation in each orthogonal direction. Measurement acceleration is achieved by applying localized tagging preparation and a hybrid multishot, segmented echo-planar imaging sequence. Five healthy volunteers and five patients with myocardial infarction were measured. Midwall contours were tracked throughout the cardiac cycle with an enhanced variant of the harmonic phase (HARP) technique. Circumferential shortening at end-systole ranged from 14.1\% (base) to 20.1\% (apex) in healthy subjects. Hypokinetic regions in patients corresponded well with regions exhibiting hyperenhancement after contrast injection. Time to maximum circumferential shortening varied more significantly over the left ventricle in patients than in volunteers (P<0.01). The proposed measurement scheme was well tolerated by patients and holds considerable potential to investigate cardiac mechanics in various diseases.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To introduce a true three-dimensional (3D) tagging technique for the assessment of myocardial tissue motion.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: To generate a 3D tagging grid, a complementary spatial modulation of magnetization (CSPAMM) was applied in three spatial directions. Imaging was performed using a conventional fast 3D gradient-echo sequence. For automatic analysis of the 3D-CSPAMM data set, evaluation software, based on a 3D extension of the HARP technique, was used.

RESULTS: Successful application of the 3D-CSPAMM technique in healthy subjects allowed the accurate determination of quantitative 3D motion patterns in the human heart.

CONCLUSION: 3D-CSPAMM may contribute to the quantification of the local 3D myocardial motion pattern throughout the cardiac cycle.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Monitoring the full spectrum of causes of death among persons with AIDS is increasingly important as survival improves because of highly active antiretroviral therapy. OBJECTIVE: To describe recent trends in deaths due to HIV-related and non-HIV-related causes among persons with AIDS, identify factors associated with these deaths, and identify leading causes of non-HIV-related deaths. DESIGN: Population-based cohort analysis. SETTING: New York City. PATIENTS: All adults (age > or =13 years) living with AIDS between 1999 and 2004 who were reported to the New York City HIV/AIDS Reporting System and Vital Statistics Registry through 2004 (n = 68,669). MEASUREMENTS: Underlying cause of death on the death certificate. RESULTS: Between 1999 and 2004, the percentage of deaths due to non-HIV-related causes increased by 32.8\% (from 19.8\% to 26.3\%; P = 0.015). The age-adjusted mortality rate decreased by 49.6 deaths per 10,000 persons with AIDS (P < 0.001) annually for HIV-related causes but only by 7.5 deaths per 10 000 persons with AIDS (P = 0.004) annually for non-HIV-related causes. Of deaths due to non-HIV-related causes, 76\% could be attributed to substance abuse, cardiovascular disease, or a non-AIDS-defining type of cancer. Compared with men who have sex with men, injection drug users had a statistically significantly increased risk for death due to HIV-related causes (hazard ratio, 1.59 [95\% CI, 1.49 to 1.70]) and non-HIV-related causes (hazard ratio, 2.54 [CI, 2.24 to 2.87]). LIMITATIONS: Compared with autopsy and chart review, death certificates may lack specificity in the underlying cause of death or detailed clinical and treatment-related information. CONCLUSIONS: Non-HIV-related causes of death account for one fourth of all deaths of persons with AIDS. Cardiovascular disease, non-AIDS-defining cancer, and substance abuse account for most non-HIV-related deaths. Reducing deaths from these causes requires a shift in the health care model for persons with AIDS from a primary focus on managing HIV infection to providing care that addresses all aspects of physical and mental health.},

abstract = {More than 450000 Americans die suddenly each year from sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. A correct identification of these patients is crucial for a rational clinical management, because the demonstrated effectiveness of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) on the reduction of sudden cardiac death. Basing on the results of multiple clinical trials, left ventricular systolic function, measured as ejection fraction, is currently the only recommended tool to identify patients at higher risk of sudden death that would benefit from a prophylactic ICD. However, the systematic implementation of prophylactic ICD recommendations results in a substantial number of inappropriate ICD implantations, while failing to prevent the majority of sudden deaths occurring in the general population. That has been the case implementing arrhythmic risk stratification with a rough arrhythmic risk marker, such as ejection fraction, that lacks sensitivity and specificity in the prediction of sudden cardiac death. The aim of this viewpoint is to critically revise the value of ejection fraction in the identification of patients at risk of sudden cardiac death.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance myocardial feature tracking (CMR-FT) is a promising novel method for quantification of myocardial wall mechanics from standard steady-state free precession (SSFP) images. We sought to determine whether magnetic field strength affects the intra-observer reproducibility of CMR-FT strain analysis.

METHODS: We studied 2 groups, each consisting of 10 healthy subjects, at 1.5 T or 3T Analysis was performed at baseline and after 4 weeks using dedicated CMR-FT prototype software (Tomtec, Germany) to analyze standard SSFP cine images. Right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) longitudinal strain (Ell(RV) and Ell(LV)) and LV long-axis radial strain (Err(LAX)) were derived from the 4-chamber cine, and LV short-axis circumferential and radial strains (Ecc(SAX), Err(SAX)) from the short-axis orientation. Strain parameters were assessed together with LV ejection fraction (EF) and volumes. Intra-observer reproducibility was determined by comparing the first and the second analysis in both groups.

RESULTS: In all volunteers resting strain parameters were successfully derived from the SSFP images. There was no difference in strain parameters, volumes and EF between field strengths (p>0.05). In general Ecc(SAX) was the most reproducible strain parameter as determined by the coefficient of variation (CV) at 1.5 T (CV 13.3\% and 46\% global and segmental respectively) and 3T (CV 17.2\% and 31.1\% global and segmental respectively). The least reproducible parameter was Ell(RV) (CV 1.5 T 28.7\% and 53.2\%; 3T 43.5\% and 63.3\% global and segmental respectively).

CONCLUSIONS: CMR-FT results are similar with reasonable intra-observer reproducibility in different groups of volunteers at 1.5 T and 3T. CMR-FT is a promising novel technique and our data indicate that results might be transferable between field strengths. However there is a considerable amount of segmental variability indicating that further refinements are needed before CMR-FT can be fully established in clinical routine for quantitative assessment of wall mechanics and strain.},

The classic form of the disease has an early predilection for the right ventricle, but recognition of left-dominant and biventricular subtypes has prompted proposal of the broader term arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. The clinical profile of the disease bridges the gap between the cardiomyopathies and inherited arrhythmia syndromes. The early "concealed" phase is characterized by propensity toward ventricular tachyarrhythmia in the setting of well-preserved morphology, histology, and ventricular function. As the disease progresses, however, myocyte loss, inflammation, and fibroadiposis become evident. Up to 40\% of cases harbor rare variants in genes encoding components of the desmosome, specialized intercellular junctions that confer mechanical strength to cardiac and epithelial tissue, and may also participate in signaling networks. Phenotypic heterogeneity and the nonspecific nature of associated features complicate clinical diagnosis, which requires multipronged cardiovascular investigation rather than a single test. Development of a prospectively validated risk-stratification algorithm for the full disease spectrum remains the foremost clinical challenge.},

New tools for quantifying regional function have been recently developed to characterize early myocardial dysfunction in order to improve the identification and management of individuals at risk for heart failure. Of particular interest is CMR myocardial tagging, a non-invasive technique for assessing regional function that provides a detailed and comprehensive examination of intra-myocardial motion and deformation. Given the current advances in gradient technology, image reconstruction techniques, and data analysis algorithms, CMR myocardial tagging has become the reference modality for evaluating multidimensional strain evolution in the human heart.

Unfortunately, many textbook treatments of the topic are written with neither illustrations nor intuition, and their victims can be found to this day babbling senselessly in the corners of dusty libraries. For this reason, a deep, geometric understanding of the method has been reserved for the elite brilliant few who have painstakingly decoded the mumblings of their forebears. Nevertheless, the Conjugate Gradient Method is a composite of simple, elegant ideas that almost anyone can understand. Of course, a reader as intelligent as yourself will learn them almost effortlessly. The idea of quadratic forms is introduced and used to derive the methods of Steepest Descent, Conjugate Directions, and Conjugate Gradients. Eigenvectors are explained and used to examine the convergence of the Jacobi Method, Steepest Descent, and Conjugate Gradients. Other topics include preconditioning and the nonlinear Conjugate Gradient Method. I have taken pains to make this article easy to read. Sixty-six illustrations are provided. Dense prose is avoided. Concepts are explained in several differentways. Most equations are coupled with an intuitive interpretation.},

Over a median follow-up of 4.8 years, 745 (29\%) participants developed hypertension. In a fully adjusted model including baseline blood pressure, the relative risks of incident hypertension from the lowest to highest LV mass quartile were 1.00 (referent), 1.13 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.89, 1.43), 1.28 (95\% CI: 1.00, 1.63), and 1.78 (95\% CI: 1.38, 2.30) (P < 0.001 for linear trend). Higher levels of LV concentric geometry, defined by higher LV mass to end-diastolic volume quartiles, were associated with higher risk of incident hypertension in a fully adjusted model (P = 0.044 for linear trend). In a final model containing both quartiles of LV mass and LV mass/volume along with all covariates including baseline blood pressure, higher LV mass quartiles were associated with incident hypertension (P < 0.001 for linear trend), whereas higher LV mass/volume quartiles were not (P = 0.643 for linear trend). In this multiethnic cohort, alterations in LV mass preceded hypertension onset among normotensive individuals.},

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) is able to identify mutation carriers of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) before the development of the clinical phenotype. However, data are scarce and have sometimes been controversial. We performed a systematic study that included conventional echocardiography, TDI, and plasma NT-probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) measurement to evaluate the parameters that could identify HC mutation carriers. A total of 138 genotyped subjects were included and divided into 3 groups: group 1, those with HC (n = 62); group 2, mutation carriers (first-degree relatives with a positive genotype but negative phenotype; n = 34); and group 3, controls (first-degree relatives with a negative genotype and phenotype; n = 42). An echocardiographic study, including TDI, was performed on all subjects, and a TDI-derived index (global function index) was also determined. The age-adjusted mean differences in the echocardiographic and TDI parameters and NT-proBNP levels were compared among the 3 groups. Compared with the HC group, the carriers had significantly higher mean E' velocities, lower mean E/E' ratio, higher mean S' velocities, and lower mean global function index and NT-proBNP values. The carriers and controls did not differ significantly either in the echocardiographic parameters studied or in the NT-proBNP levels. In conclusion, the echocardiographic and TDI parameters and NT-proBNP levels cannot be used to identify the HC mutation carrier state and therefore do not appear to be reliable for the purpose of making a preclinical diagnosis of the disease.},

abstract = {Displacement encoding with stimulated echoes (DENSE) encodes myocardial tissue displacement into the phase of the MR image. Cine DENSE allows for rapid quantification of myocardial displacement at multiple cardiac phases through the majority of the cardiac cycle. For practical sensitivities to motion, relatively high displacement encoding frequencies are used and phase wrapping typically occurs. In order to obtain absolute measures of displacement, a two-dimensional (2-D) quality-guided phase unwrapping algorithm was adapted to unwrap both spatially and temporally. Both a fully automated algorithm and a faster semi-automated algorithm are proposed. A method for computing the 2-D trajectories of discrete points in the myocardium as they move through the cardiac cycle is introduced. The error in individual displacement measurements is reduced by fitting a time series to sequential displacement measurements along each trajectory. This improvement is in turn reflected in strain maps, which are derived directly from the trajectories. These methods were validated both in vivo and on a rotating phantom. Further measurements were made to optimize the displacement encoding frequency and to estimate the baseline strain noise both on the phantom and in vivo. The fully automated phase unwrapping algorithm was successful for 767 out of 800 images (95.9\%), and the semi-automated algorithm was successful for 786 out of 800 images (98.3\%). The accuracy of the tracking algorithm for typical cardiac displacements on a rotating phantom is 0.24 +/- 0.15 mm. The optimal displacement encoding frequency is in the region of 0.1 cycles/mm, and, for 2 scans of 17-s duration, the strain noise after temporal fitting was estimated to be 2.5 +/- 3.0\% at end-diastole, 3.1 +/- 3.1\% at end-systole, and 5.3 +/- 5.0\% in mid-diastole. The improvement in intra-myocardial strain measurements due to temporal fitting is apparent in strain histograms, and also in identifying regions of dysfunctional myocardium in studies of patients with infarcts.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that many populations in the developing world are in "epidemiologic transition" with the subsequent emergence of more "affluent" disease states. The "Heart of Soweto Study" will systematically investigate the emergence of heart disease (HD) in a large urban population in South Africa.

METHODS: Part of the conurbation of Johannesburg, South Africa, Soweto is a predominantly Black African community of 1 million individuals. During an initial two year period, all individuals presenting to the local Baragwanath Hospital (3500 beds) with any form of HD will be studied. Demographic and diagnostic coding data in those with pre-established HD will form an abbreviated clinical registry of >12,000 "prevalent" cases. Similarly, socio-demographic, clinical and diagnostic data (e.g. echocardiography and ECG) in newly diagnosed patients will form a more detailed clinical registry of >5000 "incident" cases. Sub-studies of the relationship between HIV status and HD and the optimal management of chronic heart failure will also be performed.

RESULTS: These data will provide a unique insight into the causes and consequences of a broad spectrum of HD-related conditions in a "developing world" community in epidemiologic transition. Initially documented population rates, in addition to detailed examinations of the underlying risk factors and causes of HD-related morbidity/mortality will provide an important platform for future stages of the study: a community-based, population screening program and culturally specific primary and secondary programs of care.

CONCLUSION: There is an urgent need to systematically track the emergence of HD in the developing world. Initially involving more than 15,000 individuals, the unique Heart of Soweto Study has the potential to provide a wealth of information in this regard.},

abstract = {The survival of patients with HIV infection who have access to highly active antiretroviral therapy has dramatically increased. In HIV-infected persons, cardiovascular disease can be associated with HIV infection, opportunistic infections or neoplasias, use of antiretroviral drugs or treatment of opportunistic complications, mode of HIV acquisition (such as intravenous drug use), or with the classic non-HIV-related cardiovascular risk factors (such as smoking or age). Diseases of the heart associated with HIV infection or its opportunistic complications include pericarditis and myocarditis. Pericarditis may lead to pericardial effusion rarely causing tamponade. Cardiomyopathy is often clinically silent with asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Endocarditis is mainly the consequence of intravenous drug abuse, possibly leading to life-threatening valvular insufficiency with the need for cardiac surgery. A further serious condition associated with HIV infection is pulmonary hypertension potentially leading to right heart failure. The cardiovascular complications of HIV infection such as cardiomyopathy and pericarditis have been reduced by highly active antiretroviral therapy, but premature coronary atherosclerosis is now a growing problem because antiretroviral drugs can lead to serious metabolic disturbances resembling those in the metabolic syndrome. Lipodystrophy, a clinical syndrome of peripheral fat wasting, central adiposity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance, is most prevalent among patients treated with protease inhibitors. These patients should thus be screened for hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and hypertension, and they may be candidates for lipid-lowering therapies. When initiating lipid-lowering therapy, interactions between statins and HIV protease inhibitors affecting cytochrome P450 function must be considered. Restenosis rate after percutaneous coronary intervention may be unexpectedly high.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine interobserver agreement for interpretation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) and to determine sensitivity and specificity of fat detection versus functional parameters measured by MRI.

BACKGROUND: The interobserver variability of MRI and the relative importance of different MRI parameters (fat detection, regional and global right ventricular [RV] function) for ARVD diagnosis is unknown.

METHODS: Two experienced observers blinded to the clinical history independently analyzed MRI datasets obtained from 40 patients evaluated for ARVD. Twenty normal subjects underwent MRI and served as control subjects. The MRI scans were performed according to a standard protocol on a 1.5-T scanner. The observers reported on fat infiltration, global and regional RV function, myocardial thinning, and chamber dilatation qualitatively. The RV volumes were measured on the cine sequences.

RESULTS: Interobserver kappa scores for fat infiltration, global and regional RV function, wall thinning, and RV outflow dilatation were 0.74, 0.94, 0.89, 0.93, and 0.93, respectively. Correlation coefficients between observers for RV end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, and ejection fraction were 0.93, 0.94, and 0.95, respectively (p < 0.001). Fifteen patients were diagnosed with ARVD using Task Force criteria. Sensitivity of fat infiltration, RV enlargement, and regional RV dysfunction for diagnosing ARVD was 84\%, 68\%, and 78\%, and specificity was 79\%, 96\%, and 94\%, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative assessment of RV structure and function is highly reproducible for experienced observers. Among the qualitative parameters, fat infiltration is less reproducible and lacks specificity compared with RV kinetic abnormalities.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The traditional description of the Triangle of Dysplasia in Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia/Cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) predates genetic testing and excludes biventricular phenotypes.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) studies of 74 mutation-positive ARVD/C patients for regional abnormalities on a 5-segment RV and 17-segment LV model. The location of electroanatomic endo- and epicardial scar and site of successful VT ablation was recorded in 11 ARVD/C subjects. Among 54/74 (73\%) subjects with abnormal CMR, the RV was abnormal in almost all (96\%), and 52\% had biventricular involvement. Isolated LV abnormalities were uncommon (4\%). Dyskinetic basal inferior wall (94\%) was the most prevalent RV abnormality, followed by basal anterior wall (87\%) dyskinesis. Subepicardial fat infiltration in the posterolateral LV (80\%) was the most frequent LV abnormality. Similar to CMR data, voltage maps revealed scar (<0.5 mV) in the RV basal inferior wall (100\%), followed by the RV basal anterior wall (64\%) and LV posterolateral wall (45\%). All 16 RV VTs originated from the basal inferior wall (50\%) or basal anterior wall (50\%). Of 3 LV VTs, 2 localized to the posterolateral wall. In both modalities, RV apical involvement never occurred in isolation.

CONCLUSION: Mutation-positive ARVD/C exhibits a previously unrecognized characteristic pattern of disease involving the basal inferior and anterior RV, and the posterolateral LV. The RV apex is only involved in advanced ARVD/C, typically as a part of global RV involvement. These results displace the RV apex from the Triangle of Dysplasia, and provide insights into the pathophysiology of ARVD/C.},

abstract = {Myocardial function assessment is essential for determining the health of the myocardium. Global assessment of myocardial function is widely performed (by estimating the ejection fraction), but many common cardiac diseases initially affect the myocardium on a regional, rather than global basis. Regional myocardial wall motion can be quantified using myocardial strain analysis (a normalized measure of deformation). Myocardial strain can be measured in terms of three normal strains (longitudinal strain, radial strain and circumferential) and six shear strains. Cardiac MRI (cMRI) is usually considered the reference standard for measurement of myocardial strain. The most common cMRI method, termed tagged cMRI, allows full, 3D assessment of regional strain. However, due to its complexity and lengthy times for analysis, tagged cMRI is not usually used outside of academic centers. Tagged cMRI is also primarily used only in research studies. Echocardiography combined with tissue Doppler imaging or a speckle tracking technique is now widely available in the clinical setting. Myocardial strain measurement by echocardiography shows reasonable agreement with cMRI. Limited standardization and differences between vendors represent current limitations of the technique. Cardiac computed tomography (CCT) is the newest and most rapidly growing modality for noninvasive imaging of the heart. While CCT studies are most commonly applied to assess the coronary arteries, CCT is easily adapted to provide functional information for both the left and right ventricles. New methods for CCT assessment of regional myocardial function are being developed. This review outlines the current literature on imaging techniques related to cardiac strain analysis and discusses the strengths and weaknesses of various methods for myocardial strain analysis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The overt stage of arrhythmogenic right ventricular (RV) dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) is preceded by a concealed stage with minor or no signs of disease. However, sudden death may occur in this early phase. Deformation imaging may contribute to early diagnosis. The aims of this study were to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the conventional (1994) versus the recently published (2010) new echocardiographic criteria for ARVD/C and to evaluate the additional value of echocardiographic tissue deformation imaging to detect subclinical RV functional abnormalities in asymptomatic carriers of pathogenic ARVD/C mutations.

METHODS: Fourteen asymptomatic first-degree relatives of ARVD/C probands (the ARVD/C-r group; mean age, 38.0 ± 13.2 years) with a pathogenic plakophilin-2 mutation and a group of age-matched controls (n = 56; mean age, 38.2 ± 12.7 years) were included at a 1:4 ratio. A complete echocardiographic evaluation (dimensions, global systolic parameters, and visual assessment and deformation imaging of the RV free wall including Doppler tissue imaging and two-dimensional strain echocardiography) was obtained. Peak systolic strain less negative than -18\% and/or postsystolic shortening (postsystolic index > 15\%) in any RV segment was considered abnormal.

RESULTS: RV dimensions in the ARVD/C-r group were similar to those in controls (RV outflow tract, 15.4 ± 2.9 vs 14.4 ± 1.9 mm/m(2), P = NS; RV inflow tract, 18.6 ± 2.6 vs 19.1 ± 2.6 mm/m(2), P = NS), and global systolic parameters were moderately reduced (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, 20.0 ± 3.2 vs 23.9 ± 2.8 mm, P = .001; RV fractional area change, 40.3 ± 8.4 vs 40.6 ± 7.1, P = NS). According to task force criteria, 57\% of the ARVD/C-r group and 29\% of controls were classified as abnormal when applying the 1994 criteria and 29\% and 4\% when applying the 2010 criteria, respectively. Doppler tissue imaging and two-dimensional strain deformation (and strain rate) values were reduced in the ARVD/C-r group in the basal and mid RV segments compared with controls (P < .001). In the ARVD/C-r group, peak systolic strain less negative than -18\% was seen in six patients (43\%), postsystolic strain in nine (64\%), and either abnormality in 10 (71\%), almost exclusively in the basal segment; these findings were observed in none of the controls.

CONCLUSIONS: The 2010 criteria for ARVD/C improve specificity, whereas sensitivity is significantly reduced in this asymptomatic population. In contrast, echocardiographic deformation imaging detects functional abnormalities in the subtricuspid region in 71\% of asymptomatic carriers of a pathogenic plakophilin-2 mutation, while regional deformation was normal in all control subjects, indicating superiority of both sensitivity and specificity with these new modalities.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of new quantitative echocardiographic strain and strain-rate imaging parameters to identify abnormal regional right ventricular (RV) deformation associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C).

METHODS: A total of 34 patients with ARVD/C (confirmed by Task Force criteria) and 34 healthy controls were prospectively enrolled. Conventional echocardiography, including Doppler tissue imaging (DTI), was performed. Doppler and two-dimensional strain-derived velocity, strain, and strain rate were calculated in the apical, mid, and basal segments of the RV free wall.

RESULTS: RV dimensions were significantly increased in patients with ARVD/C (RV outflow tract 19.3+/-5.2 mm/m2 vs 14.1+/-2.2 mm/m2, P<.001; RV inflow tract 23.4+/-4.8 mm/m2 vs 18.8+/-2.4 mm/m2, P<.001), whereas left ventricular dimensions were not significantly different compared with controls. Strain and strain rate values were significantly lower in patients with ARVD/C in all 3 segments. All deformation parameters showed a higher accuracy to detect functional abnormalities compared with conventional echocardiographic criteria of dimensions or global systolic function. The lowest DTI strain value in any of the 3 analyzed segments showed the best receiver operating characteristics (area under the curve 0.97) with an optimal cutoff value of -18.2\%.

CONCLUSIONS: DTI and two-dimensional strain-derived parameters are superior to conventional echocardiographic parameters in identifying ARVD/C. This novel technique may have additional value in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected ARVD/C.},

This is the first report demonstrating MV abnormalities in very young children as the sole overt clinical feature of a known HCM-causing sarcomere protein gene mutation. Due to MV leaflet elongation, we also noticed a typical fast diastolic swinging motion of the MV in our patients. This novel echocardiographic feature may be used as a clinical marker of HCM disease in the absence of left ventricular hypertrophy.},

abstract = {Aortic valve stenosis impairs subendocardial perfusion with a risk of irreversible subendocardial tissue damage. A likely precursor of damage is subendocardial contractile dysfunction, expressed by the parameter TransDif, which is defined as epicardial minus endocardial myofiber shortening, normalized to the mean value. With the use of magnetic resonance tagging in two short-axis slices of the left ventricle (LV), TransDif was derived from LV torsion and contraction during ejection. TransDif was determined in healthy volunteers (control, n = 9) and in patients with aortic valve stenosis before (AVSten, n = 9) and 3 mo after valve replacement (AVRepl, n = 7). In the control group, TransDif was 0.00 +/- 0.14 (mean +/- SD). In the AVSten group, TransDif increased to 0.96 +/- 0.62, suggesting impairment of subendocardial myofiber shortening. In the AVRepl group, TransDif decreased to 0.37 +/- 0.20 but was still elevated. In eight of nine AVSten patients, the TransDif value was elevated individually (P < 0.001), suggesting that the noninvasively determined parameter TransDif may provide important information in planning of treatment of aortic valve stenosis.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To validate a method for measuring 3D left ventricular (LV) strain from phase-unwrapped harmonic phase (HARP) images derived from tagged cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A set of 40 human subjects were imaged with tagged MRI. In each study the HARP phase was computed and unwrapped in each short-axis and long-axis image. Inconsistencies in unwrapped phase were resolved using branch cuts manually placed with a graphical user interface. 3D strain maps were computed for all imaged timeframes in each study. The strain from unwrapped phase (SUP) and displacements were compared to those estimated by a feature-based (FB) technique and a HARP technique.

RESULTS: 3D strain was computed in each timeframe through systole and mid-diastole in approximately 30 minutes per study. The standard deviation of the difference between strains measured by the FB and the SUP methods was less than 5\% of the average of the strains from the two methods. The correlation between peak circumferential strain measured using the SUP and HARP techniques was over 83\%.

CONCLUSION: The SUP technique can reconstruct full 3D strain maps from tagged MR images through the cardiac cycle in a reasonable amount of time and user interaction compared to other 3D analysis methods.},

In the past few years, numerous efforts have been devoted to cardiac motion recovery and deformation analysis from MR image sequences. Many approaches have been proposed for tracking cardiac motion and for computing deformation parameters and mechanical properties of the heart from a variety of cardiac MR imaging techniques. In this paper, an updated and critical review of cardiac motion tracking methods including major references and those proposed in the past ten years is provided. The MR imaging and analysis techniques surveyed are based on cine MRI, tagged MRI, phase contrast MRI, DENSE, and SENC. This paper can serve as a tutorial for new researchers entering the field.},

@article{Williams2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Regional and global function can be measured by echocardiography using speckle-tracking, a technique that has previously been validated against crystal sonomicrometry. However, the application of Velocity Vector Imaging (VVI) to images obtained from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging has never been validated against those values derived from VVI applied to two-dimensional echocardiographic images in the same patient group. The aim of this study was to validate for the first time the application of VVI to retrospectively acquired CMR data sets for the assessment of left ventricular strain and rotation, using echocardiographic strain assessment by VVI as the reference technique.

METHODS: Cine steady-state free precession CMR data sets and two-dimensional echocardiographic images obtained on the same day in 36 adult patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were analyzed retrospectively using VVI to quantify global longitudinal and circumferential strain and rotation parameters.

RESULTS: The absolute differences in longitudinal strain between the two imaging modalities were -1.1 ± 3.3\% (endocardial) and -2.2 ± 3.6\% (full thickness). The absolute differences in circumferential strain were -4.7 ± 5.3\% (endocardial) and -3.4 ± 3.8\% (full thickness). CMR consistently resulted in higher strain values than echocardiography. The absolute differences in twist were -0.2 ± 5.6\% (endocardial) and 0.1 ± 5.8\% (full thickness).

CONCLUSIONS: The application of VVI to CMR data sets allows a feasible and reproducible method for strain analysis in HCM, demonstrating excellent agreement with two-dimensional echocardiography-derived values. Given the superior image quality obtained with CMR in a significant proportion of patients, this technique provides a method for strain assessment without the need for dedicated CMR acquisition and analytic techniques.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To evaluate the presence of myocardial structural alterations and subtle myocardial dysfunction during familial screening in asymptomatic mutation carriers without hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) phenotype.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: Sixteen HCM families with pathogenic mutation were studied and 46 patients with phenotype expression (Mut+/Phen+) and 47 patients without phenotype expression (Mut+/Phen-) were observed. Twenty-five control subjects, matched with the Mut+/Phen- group, were recruited for comparison. Echocardiography was performed to evaluate conventional parameters, myocardial structural alteration by calibrated integrated backscatter (cIBS) and global and segmental longitudinal strain by speckle tracking analysis. All 3 groups had similar left ventricular dimensions and ejection fraction. Basal anteroseptal cIBS was the highest in Mut+/Phen+ patients (-14.0±4.6 dB, p<0.01) and was higher in Mut+/Phen- patients as compared to controls (-17.0±2.3 vs. -22.6±2.9 dB, p<0.01) suggesting significant myocardial structural alterations. Global and basal anteroseptal longitudinal strains (-8.4±4.0\%, p<0.01) were the most impaired in Mut+/Phen+ patients as compared to the other 2 groups. Although global longitudinal strain was similar between Mut+/Phen- group and controls, basal anteroseptal strain was lower in Mut+/Phen- patients (-14.1±3.8\%, p<0.01) as compared to controls (-19.9±2.9\%, p<0.01), suggesting a subclinical segmental systolic dysfunction. A combination of >-19.0 dB basal anteroseptal cIBS or >-18.0\% basal anteroseptal longitudinal strain had a sensitivity of 98\% and a specificity of 72\% in differentiating Mut+/Phen- group from controls.

CONCLUSION: The use of cIBS and segmental longitudinal strain can differentiate HCM Mut+/Phen- patients from controls with important clinical implications for the family screening and follow-up of these patients.},

abstract = {Myocardial tagging with magnetic resonance imaging is useful for non- invasive estimation of in vivo heart wall deformation. To validate the method of strain estimation and quantify the error of deformation es- timates, a deformable silicone gel phantom in the shape of a cylindrical anulus was built and imaged. Four observers digitized the displacement of magnetic tags in two deformation modes: axial shear, caused by a 45\#\{176\} rotation of the inner cylinder, and azimuthal shear, caused by a 13.5-mm longitudinal translation of the inner cylinder. In axial shear, good agree- ment was found between the angular displacement of stripes painted on the gel and an analytic solution. Dis- placement of magnetic tags also agreed with that solution. Interobserver and observer model errors in deformation estimates were quantifled for homogeneous and nonhomo- geneous strain analysis. In homogeneous strain analysis, errors in point localization produced relatively large errors, which were reduced in nonho- mogeneous strain analysis. Both estimates were unbiased across the range of deformations.},

One objective of statistical analysis is to describe the marginal expectation of the outcome variable as a function of the covariates while accounting for the correlation among the repeated observations for a given subject. This paper proposes a unifying approach to such analysis for a variety of discrete and continuous outcomes. A class of generalized estimating equations (GEEs) for the regression parameters is proposed. The equations are extensions of those used in quasi-likelihood (Wedderburn, 1974, Biometrika 61, 439-447) methods. The GEEs have solutions which are consistent and asymptotically Gaussian even when the time dependence is misspecified as we often expect. A consistent variance estimate is presented. We illustrate the use of the GEE approach with longitudinal data from a study of the effect of mothers' stress on children's morbidity.},
